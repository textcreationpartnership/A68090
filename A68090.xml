            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>¶ To the right high &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prince, Henrye the ſecond, <hi>king of Nauarre, Prince of Bearn,</hi> Duke of Vandome and Albret, Earle of Foyze, Arminack, Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois, Bigorie, Marle. &amp;c,</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>YR, it is not without cauſe, nor without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aumple, that I dare take vpon mee to dedycate vnto your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, this litle A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologye, which contayneth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, and of the Profeſſors of the ſame. For in aſmuch as your Maieſtie hath euen from your youth, vndertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the defence therof with the haſard of your life &amp; gooddes for the ſame: I could not more fitly preferre the iuſtification of ſo holy a cauſe to any, than to your Highnes, who haue alwayes maintayned the ſame: not onely in words, but alſo by deedes, and that with moſt noble and Princely courage, following the renowmed footſteps of the late Queen of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> your mother, whoſe godlynes, curteſie, and other heroicall vertues, are conſecrated for euer to moſt honorable eternitie. And I haue beene led to take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me this defence &amp; to dedicate it to your Maieſtie, by the example of many good and godly men in the Primitiue church, who in their times wrote diuers Apologies,
<pb facs="tcp:3170:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> in defence of the Chriſtians againſt the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reportes and illuſions of the heathen, and did put them vp to the Romayn Emperors that were in thoſe dayes: who (notwithſtanding that they were heathen Princes, and ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the true Religion) were moued by them to ſuccor the Chriſtians, and to ſurceaſe the perſecutions that were made againſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quadratus</hi> and <hi>Ariſtydes</hi> wrote Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies in their times, in defence of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans againſt the heathen, and dedicated them to the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> who hauing reade them, and perceiuing therby that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans worſhipped the great God which gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all the world: and that in the exerciſing of their Religion, they did not any thing that was preiudiciall to the lawes of the Romain Empire, but rather prayed for the proſperitie of him and of his Empire: ſent a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Fundanus</hi> the gouerner of <hi>Aſia,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he forbad the perſecuting of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any more, as in reſpect of Religion, and commaunded that the ſlaunderers of them ſhould be ſore puniſhed.</p>
            <p>And moreouer he cauſed diuers faire chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches to be builded in many places, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Images, pictures, or portratures, greatly allowing the doctrine of the Chriſtians, for that it forbiddeth the painting and portray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, the worſhipping of Images, or the hauing of them in their churches.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe <hi>Iuſtine</hi> the Philoſopher wrote in his time two Apologies that are come to light, in defence of the Chriſtians againſt the falſe accuſations of the heathen: whereof he dedicateth the one to the Senate of Rome, &amp; the other to the Emperor <hi>Antonine</hi> the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: who being moued therat, made a generall
<pb facs="tcp:3170:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> law, wherby he reſtrayned the heathen from their falſe blaming of the Chriſtians, for the earthquakes and other publike calamities, willing them to impute them to their owne ſinnes, for he ſayd that the Chriſtians wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the great God more deuoutely, than the heathen themſelues worſhipped the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their Gods.</p>
            <p>And he prohibited all men, aſwell Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates as priuate perſons, to perſecute the Chriſtians any more, or to ſlaunder them with accuſations or falſe crimes: commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to obſerue the foreſayd proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his father and Predeceſſor the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Adrian,</hi> in all pointes.</p>
            <p>Alſo <hi>Melito</hi> the Biſhop of Sardis, wrot an Apologie in defence of the Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Heathen, which he dedicated to the Emperor <hi>Marke Antony</hi> the Philoſopher, who was moued therby to fauor the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and to cauſe the perſecutions to ceaſe, which had bin made in the Prouinces of the Empire without his knowledge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, by the Gouernors and other Magiſtrates which abuſed the mildnes and clemency of their Prince, as a number doe in theſe dayes. Yea and this good Emperor fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by experience, that the Chriſtians were the good and welbeloued ſeruants of the true God, (for he wan a great battell againſt the <hi>Marcomannes</hi> and <hi>Quades,</hi> by the only pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of a Legion of Chriſtian Soldiars that were in his army) not only forbad the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of the Chriſtians by open Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo gaue leaue to become Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to as many as would: willing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding that all ſuch as accuſed any man alonly in reſpect of Chriſtian Religion, ſhold
<pb facs="tcp:3170:4"/> be greeuouſly puniſhed as coſoners and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and that no Chriſtian ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to change his Religion.</p>
            <p>Many others beſides theſe (as <hi>Tertulian</hi> and <hi>Appollinaris</hi>) haue pleaded and mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned the ſame cauſe, by ſetting forth A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologies, which haue greatly auayled, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with the Heathen Emperors of their times: who (to ſay the truth) as heatheniſh as they were, haue treden out the way to the Princes of our dayes, which beare the titles of Chriſtians and Catholicks, to ſhew them what vprightnes and modeſty they ought to vſe in the caſe of Religion.</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch therfore, as our reformed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is blamed and outragiouſly defaced now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adayes, by ſuch as neither do nor wil vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it: I, after the example of ſo many good perſons, haue ſet my hand to the pen, to ſhew by this ſhort defence, that the ſame is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded vpon Gods pure word, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently agreeing with the Chriſten Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the primatiue Church, but alſo that it is warranted by the very Canons of the Popes themſelues, and of the Church of Rome, And I am ſure that your maieſtye (being naturally enclined to the peace of Fraunce) will not onely take more pleaſure to heare the ſound of theſe Canons, than the ſound of thoſe which haue ſo often times ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly thundered, to the deſtruction of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate kingdome of Fraunce, but alſo be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to maintaine the ſame Religion conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more, and to be a meane to the French king our ſoueraign Lord, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe and quietnes of ſuch as profeſſe the ſame. For if the heathen Emperors (whom I haue named afore) haue vouchſafed to releeue and
<pb facs="tcp:3170:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> fauor the Chriſtians in their times, without hauing any further knowledge of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, than that it contayned not any thing contrary to the Ciuill Lawes: how much more ought we to hope for the like at the handes of our moſt Chriſtian king, by your interceſſion, ſpecially ſeeing that our Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion (thanks be to God) contayneth not any doctrine which may not well beſeeme good Chriſtians, and which tendeth not to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing of kings, and of their eſtates, as his maieſtie may eaſely diſcerne, if it may pleaſe him to heare our reaſons, or but only to looke vpon this litle Apologie.</p>
            <p>And ſurely Sir, we aſſure ourſelues that you will alwayes continue to be a mean to his Maieſtie euery day better than other, for the maintenance and quyetnes of vs and our Religion, becauſe you were brought vp in it in your young time, and haue made a good pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſion of it. Beſides this, the famous exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of your noble anceſtors which haue been euer renowmed for their godlynes, doe direct you to the following of their footeſteps. For the Hiſtories doe auow vnto vs, that your Anceſtors of the renowmed houſe of <hi>Burbon,</hi> (for I will not ſpeake of thoſe of late time, whoſe remembrance being yet freſh in mens mindes, and will continue honorable for euer among them that come after vs) haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been had in honor for their great zeale towards the Chriſtian Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and for their feruent loue to the mayntenance of the crown of Fraunce, &amp; of the quyetnes of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which are two principall points where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in godlynes ſhineth forth.</p>
            <p>For firſt of all, the great and dangerous voyages which your Anceſtors haue made
<pb facs="tcp:3170:5"/> with men of warre into the Eaſt countreys, and into Affrike, againſt the Turkes &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſyns, for the great deſire they had to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance the Chriſtian Religion, (as the two voyages of king <hi>Lewis</hi> the ſaint: The two voyages of <hi>Lewes</hi> Duke of Burbon: and the voyages of many other princes of their race) doe yeald ſufficient record of their Religious and godly diſpoſition. And although that in thoſe dayes (by reaſon of the great ignorance of languages, and of good learning, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the pure doctrine) Religion was not ſo well vnderſtoode, nor ſo purely taught as it is nowadayes through the grace of god: yet it is not to be douted but that if they had had a purer and cleerer vnderſtanding therof, they would haue been ſo much the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and zealous in it.</p>
            <p>And as touching loue and dutifulnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their countrey (which is the ſecond poynt wherin godlynes conſiſteth) your ſayd au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceſtors haue geuen ſo good tryall therof, by their contynuall imploying of themſelues va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyantly in the defence and inlarging of the Crown of Fraunce, aſwell againſt forrain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, as againſt the diſturbers of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace, that the houſe of Burbone hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes iuſtly had this honorable reporte, to haue been alwayes a floriſhing branch of the bloud Royall, and a ſure piller of the liberty and ſafety of the Realme: As for example, <hi>Iaques</hi> of Burbon Earl of March, and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of Fraunce, gaue good proofe of his loue towards the welfare of his countrey, and towards the Crown of Fraunce, in hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe in many battailes againſt the Engliſh men, then almoſt inuincible enemies of this Realme, ſpecially at the battel of Poy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiers
<pb facs="tcp:3170:5"/> in the time of king <hi>Iohn,</hi> and alſo in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his indeuour with great good will to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the peace at Britany, and to driue the Companions and Outlawes out of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which tooke their pleaſure in ſpoyling the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trey, and in maintayning of trouble in the Realme.</p>
            <p>Alſo <hi>Lewis</hi> of Burbon the firſt Earl of Va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, (for that Earldome fell vnto him by his mother) made warre againſt the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen in the time of king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt, not only in Fraunce, but alſo euen in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and he was a curteous Prince, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable to his Countrey, aſwell in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of war as of peace.</p>
            <p>His ſonne (named <hi>Lewis</hi> alſo) being then Lord great maſter of Fraunce, was in many battailes, where he fought valiantly, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the battaile of Agincourt, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he was taken priſoner by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen, with many other great Princes and Lords of Fraunce. Likewiſe he was one of thoſe that toke moſt paines to make the peace at Arras, in the time of king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth, for the ſuppreſſing of the Ciuil wars, which had indured ſo long time, welnere to the vtter deſtruction of the Realme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> of Burbon Earle of Vandome and ſonne of the ſayd <hi>Lewis,</hi> was alſo a virtuous Prince, and a valyant warryor, and aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe in many a battaile, ſpecially at the ſiege of Fronſack in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Marches of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deloys, where he was made knight for his va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liant deſertes: and he was one of the Princes which tooke part with <hi>Lewis</hi> the Dolphin, and with the Dukes of Burbon and Alaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in ſetting themſelues againſt the wicked and tirannicall dealings of certayne timeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb facs="tcp:3170:6"/> and flatterers of king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth, Fraunces of Burbon his ſonne, a good and ſtout prince went in the viage to Naples with king Charles the eighth, and behaued himſelfe nobly in matters both of peace and warre, to the honor and profite of the Crowne of Fraunce, and of his whole country. But I ſhould not ſoone make an end, if I minded to recken vp all the excellent princes of your maieſties moſt renowmed houſe of Burbon: and much les ſhould I do it if I ment to take vpon me to rehearſe their heroycall deedes and vertues, which would require many great volumes. But I thinke it inough for me to haue named ſome few of them, that might ſerue for examples to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and to all other men, to ſpeed themſelues valiantly in the defence and mayntaynance of the peace of their countrye. Which examples wil (in my opinion) be the better liked of your maieſty, becauſe they come not onely of your owne houſe, (which hath alwayes been moſt fruitfull in noble and vertuous princes:) but alſo of the Linial diſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of your progenytors. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> late king of Nauare your father, was the ſonne of <hi>Charles</hi> of Burbon the firſt duke of Vandome: who was ſonne of the foreſayd Fraunces Earle of Vandome: who was ſonne to the forenamed <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was ſonne to the foreſayd Lewis Lord great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Fraunce: who was the ſonne of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lewis,</hi> the firſt Earle of Vandome: who was the ſon of <hi>Iohn</hi> Earle of March: who was the ſonne of <hi>Iaques</hi> Earle of March and conſtable of Fraunce: who was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of <hi>Lewis</hi> firſt duke of Burbon ſurnamed the great duke: who was the ſonne of Robert of Fraunce Earle of Cleremount and Beaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyſin:
<pb facs="tcp:3170:6"/> who was the Sonne of good king <hi>Lewis</hi> the ſaynt.</p>
            <p>And ſo your Maieſtie is the eleuenth in order, deſcending in the right line from S. <hi>Lewis</hi> your great Anceſtor, whoſe vertues I hope that God will make to grow more and more in your Royall perſon, making you to be a follower of his ſteps in that he was a good defender of the Chriſtian Religion, a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of vpright iuſtice, a natiue example of good manners, a ſeuere correcter of partiall &amp; corrupt Iudges, an vntreatable puniſher of blaſphemers, Atheiſtes, and vſurers, and a zealous furtherer of all good reformation.</p>
            <p>But now to come back agayn to my mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: I hope that ſuch of the Romain Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as ſhall reade this my wryting, ſhall haue no cauſe to finde fault with me, or to ſay that I deale to roughly with them. For hauing once ſimply and without any bitterneſſe, ſet down my reaſon vpon euery point, and hauing alleadged the very text of the holy Scripture to confirme our doctrine, and to diſprooue theirs: I geue them yet this aduantage fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I come into the liſtes againſt them with their own weapons, which they take to be moſt for their own defence, and moſt hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to vs, that is to wit, the Canons, made or authoriſed by the very Popes themſelues. Wherein I thinke I haue done ſo much by the grace of God, that either they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the Pope and his Canons, or els con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that our Religion is voyd of all error.</p>
            <p>True it is that many learned men of our time, haue ſufficiently already ſet forth the purenes of our Religion by the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yea and that much better than I could ſkill to doe: Inſomuch that in that reſpect,
<pb facs="tcp:3170:7"/> many may thinke that I doe but make repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions. Howbeit foraſmuch as I haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hand (as you would ſay) to leuell or bend the Canons in defence of ourſelues, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch perſons as beate vs with them, and vnduely doe attribute aſmuch or more authoritie to them, than to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe: I haue conſidered that it were no reaſon for me to commit the ſame faulte, which they doe. And therfore my intent is, to alleadge the very text of the ſcripture vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euery poynt, for the true and ſure groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our doctrine, and not to beſtow the Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nons otherwiſe, than in beating downe the contrary doctrine.</p>
            <p>I know well that the time is now ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and ſorrowfull in Fraunce, that moſt men take all good things in ill part, and that euen thoſe which beſt know the way how to heale our ſores, are ſo ill minded, that they will not vſe it. And (in good hower be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) we may well ſay as <hi>Liuie</hi> ſayd ſpeaking of the time of the Ciuill warres in Rome,<note place="margin">Tit. liu. lib. <hi>1.</hi> in praefaci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>one.</note> (which began vnder <hi>Silla</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> and contynued vnder <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and ſo held on in quarrelling and parttaking ſtil vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ſucceſſors: (a time in all points like to this ſorrowfull time of ours) that this Realme of Fraunce is brought to ſo extreme corruption, as it may no longer indure, either her owne vices, or the remedy of them.</p>
            <p>And in good ſooth, euery man may well perceiue the vices of diſſention, rancor, ciuill warre, and corruption both of manners and doctrine, which are ſowed at this day, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to deepe rooted in our French nation. And likewiſe all men of any vnderſtanding, doe well ſee that the very remedy to rid away
<pb facs="tcp:3170:7"/> theſe miſchiefes, were to admit ſome good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, aſwell in doctrine as in diſcipline, and in outward behauiour.</p>
            <p>But France is in the ſame taking that a poore ſick man is, when the extremity of his fitte is vpon him: who can neither ſuffer his diſeaſe patiently, nor willingly receiue the me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dicine that ſhould doe him good. For all of vs doe well inough perceiue our diſeaſe, and we know well it is great and dangerous, and we would faine be healed of it, but the moſt parte of vs doe finde that the medicine of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to irkeſome, wherein ſurely men doe greatly ouerſhoote themſelues, for there is not ſo much payne nor diſpleaſure in leading of a ſober &amp; modeſt life, as ther is in leading of a loſe life. Beſides y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſober, wel ſtaid, &amp; wel reformed life in good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners &amp; doctrine, is ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>companied with great quietnes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience: &amp; (as ſayth <hi>Cicero</hi>) doth commonly lead y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body to a healthfull and honorable old age. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we had no other cauſe to deſire refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, than for the ceaſing of our vntollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble troubles: were not that cauſe inough, ſith it is not to be douted but that they will neuer be throughly brought a ſleepe, vntill the cauſe of them (that is to wit, the error, corruption, and looſenes that is among vs) be firſt quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and done away, by a ſound reformation aſwel inwardly as outwardly? For naturally all cauſes bring forth effects like themſelues.</p>
            <p>And againe it is certayne, that God being righteous, is wont to continue in ſtriking with his reuenging roddes, vpon ſuch as har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>den themſelues in their ſinnes, and ſtand kic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king againſt the ſpurre. If we conſidered the monſtruous waſting and ſpoyling of things which Ciuill warres are wont to breede,
<pb facs="tcp:3170:8"/> (whereof we haue ſeene but too many by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) the heare of our heads would ſtand vp at it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> (rehearſing the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes that befell to the Empire of Rome, by the Ciuill warres that were in the time of the Emperors <hi>Galba, Vitellus,</hi> and <hi>Otho</hi>) ſayth that in thoſe fiery broyles, the goodlieſt Prouinces of the Empire ſtaggered, incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to a change of ſtate, and to an ouerthrow of the Monarchicall gouernment, where-through they had felt ſo many oppreſſions, by meanes of the quarrels and parttakinges of great men, who ſhot at no other marke, but to deſtroy one another. Inſomuch that in thoſe times, there was euery where greate murthering of men, burning of townes, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of holy thinges, exceſſiue cruelty, euen in the Citie of Rome it ſelfe, deflouring of the nobleſt Ladies, and baniſhing of the honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and honorableſt men. The vertuouſeſt folkes went ſooneſt to wrecke. Notable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy, and great riches, dignitie and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, executed, or left vnexecuted for feare, were taken for crimes. The ſeruant was wrought either by terror or by treachery, to be againſt his maſter, and the bondman was ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty againſt his Lord. Such as had no enemies were ouerthrowen by the ſuttle packing of their frends. Truth was oppreſſed, partly through the ignorance of the Gouerner, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the crafty iugling of flatterers, and partly through the ſpyting of ſuch as held the helme.</p>
            <p>It was not lawfull for a man to thinke what he liſted, nor to ſpeak what he knew. The wickednes of the flatterers who had wonne the eares of the Prince, and the great
<pb facs="tcp:3170:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> rewards which they obtained for their flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, (as Conſulſhips, gouernments of Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uinces, preferments to Prieſthods, ſpoilings of Countreis, and excheting of mens goods,) were hated and abhorred alike of all people. The ſmall Countreis, which ſometimes were intangled in thoſe Ciuill broyles, were full of cruell deedes. The ſeas were coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with folke that had been baniſhed and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out of their own houſes: the rocks of the ſea were peſtered about with the carkaſes of folke murthered: and the good Cities were quite &amp; cleane ſoked from all their ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the fruites in effect, which the great and pollitick wiſe man <hi>Tacitus</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to come and grow ordinarily of partta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings and Ciuill diſcords. Whereof we haue felt ſo good ſtore by the ſpace of ſeuenteene yeares alredy, or there abouts, that we ought now long ere this to haue deſired and ſought the remedye that might haue cured our ſo ſtrange miſfortunes and barbarous calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Yea and euen they which are the moſt ſworne enemies of the reformed Religion, ought to become aſſured by the proof of time paſt, that for all that euer they can doe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, they ſhall neuer ſo deface the truth, and vertue, but that they ſhall ſtand ſtill ſpight of all the corruptinges and darckninges of this world, and of the maintayners of them.</p>
            <p>And in very deede, God (who gouerneth the doings of all men in the world by his pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uidence) hath reſerued ſtill in this miſerable world, a great number of good and honeſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and of ſuch as loue vertue. And like as in the foreſayd time of the Ciuill warres among the Romaynes, <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſayth that that age was not ſo barrayn of honeſt men, but that
<pb facs="tcp:3170:9"/> it brought forth ſome good examples: ſo alſo may we ſay that euen in this age of oures, how much ſoeuer it be infected and corrupted, yet hath God of his gratious goodnes reſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued many ſtill, which to follow the pure Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion and vertue, haue conſtantly indured po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerty, loſſe of their goods, the cruell murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their children, kinſfolke, and frendes, baniſhment out of their Countrey, abſence from their houſes, and an infinite number of other aduerſities and inconueniences. Which thing geueth vs aſſurance that our Lord god will alwayes maintayne a certayn number of good men here below, which ſhall imbrace vertue by maintayning good lawes and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and follow the light of the truth which abideth inuincible for euer, and ſhall ſcatter the miſtes and cloudes that ſet themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt it.</p>

For this king hauing vpon a time made a royall feaſt to all the Gouernors, Cap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taynes, and other Officers of his Dominion, (which was ſo great that it extended ouer a hundreth and ſeuen and twenty Prouinces,) was contented to heare a diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> between three young Gentlemen of Iury, that were attendant vpon his own perſon. Of whom the one maintayned that nothing is ſtronger than wine, becauſe that commonly it ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth aſwell the great as the ſmall. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſayd that nothing was ſtronger than a king, becauſe that with one only word of his mouth, he can make men to be ſlayne, Cities to be razed, and Fortreſſes to be beaten down when he liſteth. And the third named <hi>Zoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babell,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3170:9"/> (a gentleman of the bloud royall deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended of the line of <hi>Dauid</hi>) vpheld that truth is ſtrongeſt of all things, becauſe it conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth in force euerlaſtingly, and ſhall raigne for euer and euer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Darius</hi> hauing heard this diſputation, and knowing well how it is moſt certayne, that truth is the thing of greateſt ſtrength, and of longeſt contynuance in all the world, gaue the prize to <hi>zorabable</hi> as to him that had been of beſt opinion, and gaue him great giftes and priuiledges, aſwell for himſelfe as for all his wholl nation, commaunding that from thence forth <hi>Zorobabell</hi> ſhould be called the kinges Coſen. Which iudgement of this great king, ought to be wel conſidered of all perſons, and ſpecially of kinges and Princes, that they may geue themſelues earneſtly to the ſeeking out of the truth in all thinges, as well in caſe of Religion as in Ciuil and worldly affaires, and eſteeme it more ſtrong and inuincible tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any force of man.</p>
            <p>For certainly, there is neither king nor Emperor, fire nor ſword, payne nor torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that euer could quench the truth, or ouercome it. But foraſmuch as in theſe dayes, many men are doutfull in the caſe of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where they ſhould ſeeke the truth, I will not here forget the rule which the great Emperor of Rome <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did ſet down at the coſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Nice in Bithinia,<note place="margin">Trip. hiſt. li <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>5.</hi>
               </note> for the decyding of the points of doctrine, which were to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled and treated of there. For hauing aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Councell together, to determine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the doctrine that <hi>Arrius</hi> had ſowed at that time: When he had made the Biſhoppes to take their places euery one in his degree, (which were to the number of 318. beſides
<pb facs="tcp:3170:10"/> the Elders and Deacons that accompanyed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who were aboue 500.) he ſate him down among them in a low chaire, and made this Oration to them well beſeeming his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and godlynes.</p>
            <p>My Lords and fathers (quoth he) foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as God hath vouchſafed to put down the cruell Princes by my hand, and to geue peace to the world vnder my raign, it is meete that you alſo in this holy aſſembly, ſhould doe your indeuoures to ſet a ſtable vnitie and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Church. For it were to euill an example if after the ouercomming of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the publick peace ſhould now be diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the controuerſies and diſagreementes of the Shepheards of the Church, a thing that would miniſter occaſion and matter to the vngodly to mock our Religion, &amp; to laugh it to ſcorn. Now then, ſith we be to treat here of diuine matters, we muſt tak y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of the holy Ghoſt for our rule, and reſort to the bookes of the Euangeliſtes, Apoſtles, and Prophets, which teach vs what opinion we ought to be of concerning Gods holy law.</p>
            <p>Therfore ſetting aſide all ſtoutnes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, let vs ſeeke the reſolution of our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions in the word that is inſpired by God.</p>
            <p>After this ſhort and notable ſpeech made by that great Emperor, the Councel was held, and the doctrine of Arrius was throughly debated by the only word of God, and in the end iuſtly condemned by thoſe holy Fathers, as vtterly contrary to a number of expreſſe places of the holy Scriptures, which auow vnto vs the Godhead and euerlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the ſonne of God, which thing <hi>Arrius</hi> did wickedly deny.</p>
            <p>But I muſt tell you by the way, that in
<pb facs="tcp:3170:10"/> this ſpeech of <hi>Conſtantines,</hi> we haue three dueties to marke, which doe wel beſeeme a great Prince. The one is to be inclyned to publicke peace and tranquillitie, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the maintenance thereof by all lawfull meanes. Another is to loue the truth aboue al things, chiefly in caſes of Religion. And the third is, to ſeeke the ſame truth in the Scripture inſpired by God.</p>
            <p>Now I beſeech God of his gracious good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, to make your Maieſties vertue &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines to ſhine forth dayly more and more, in thoſe holy dueties, and to cauſe your Royall highnes to grow greater and greater in all his heauenly giftes, and in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and felicitie.</p>

For, by the law of nature (as witneſſeth the Ciuil law) we ought to heare their reaſons, and defences, whoſe cauſe we haue to iudge of, &amp; therein to doe as we would be done vnto, as Nature willeth, and commandeth vs. And therfore, theſe ouerangry Catholickes, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, hate, and perſecute, the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3170:13"/> of the reformed religion, without vnderſtanding it, or without hearing them, do wel bewray therby, that their panges and paſſions are very ſtrange, for that they haue ſuch force, as to cauſe them to forget the law of Nature, the knowledge wherof God hath imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the hartes of all men, euen from their creation. Truly, it is a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and beaſtly thing, that a man ſhold ſo yealde himſelfe to the humor of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, rancor, enuy, deſire of reuenge, &amp; ſuch like frenzes, as that he ſhould rob himſelfe of his naturall wit, and cauſe himſelfe to forget the right vſe of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">nun</note> as you may well ſee by the doinges of thoſe heady perſons. I know right well that they haue been accuſtomed to cloake theſe paſſions, by ſaying that the <hi>Pope,</hi> the Counſel of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the <hi>Sorboniſtes,</hi> haue long agoe, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the reformed Religion, as erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hereticall, and that therfore, it is to be holden for a reſolution, that it is naught, and to be condemned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther inquirie of the matter, and without any other forme or proceſſe of Law.</p>
            <p>But hereunto it hath euer been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, as we do ſtill, that thoſe which

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3170:14"/> for heretickes) did make this worthy, &amp; wiſe anſwere.

            </p>
            <p>Hereupon it was told the Kinge, that the religion which thoſe of <hi>Cabry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and <hi>Meryndol,</hi> did profeſſe, had bin often, before that time, condemned for hereticall, and wicked: ſpecially in the Councell of <hi>Laterane, Anno. 1179.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But, notwithſtanding, all theſe ſhewes, and prouocations, this good king would not be led from his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: Saying, that he would not ſtretch his conſcience ſo far, as to make a preſident of the iudgements, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of thoſe Popes, King, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, but would heare the anſwers of the parties accuſed, before he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3170:15"/>
            <p>And thereupon, he gaue audience to the Comiſſioners of <hi>Cabryers,</hi> and <hi>Meryndol.</hi> And when he had heard the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he ſent thether <hi>Adam Fume</hi> his Maſter of requeſtes, and <hi>Ihon Paruyz</hi> his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, to informe him of their life, and doctrine. Who made report to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, that it was true, that thoſe of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryers,</hi> and <hi>Meryndol,</hi> had neither maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nor Images in their churches, but that otherwiſe, they were all well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed (yea, euen the very litle ones) in the articles of the fayth, and in the commaundementes of God, and that they vtterly abſtayned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous othes, and whoredome, keping holy the Sabaoth day, and greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenſing the ſupper of our Lord, bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſme, and maryage. Which when the king thus vnderſtoode, he did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not condemne them of hereſie (as he was intyſed to haue done,) but alſo, quite otherwiſe, did pronounce with his owne voyce (and bound it with an othe) that he did beleeue, that thoſe of <hi>Meryndoll,</hi> and <hi>Cabryers,</hi> were better, and more honeſt people, than himſelfe, or any of his other ſubiectes.</p>
            <p>And what, will you infer, of this? will you ſay now that this good king
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3170:15"/> was a Proteſtant, or that he miſlyked the Romayn Religion? I think there is no man ſo ſhameles, that dares ſay ſo: For his life, and actes do ſhew, that he was very well minded towardes the church of Rome: In maintenance wherof, he held great warres in <hi>Italy</hi> againſt the <hi>Venecians,</hi> and other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that vſurped vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> patrimonies of the Church.</p>
            <p>But he was a good king, and did acknowledge, that God had put the Scepter in his hand, to miniſter iuſtice to all his people, and not to condemne the accuſed, without hearing their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: nor to iudge of a matter of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, by the conſciences of others: but meekly to geue hearing to al mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters brought before him, &amp; not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thoſe thinges for euill, which may ſhew themſelues to be good. I therfore, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude thus, that thoſe which in theſe dayes, doe ſo preſumptuouſlye condemne the reformed Religion, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing any deſerued cauſe, or without hearing ſuch as profeſſe the ſame, vnder color of the condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s done already by the Popes, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and by the <hi>Sorboniſtes,</hi> doe ſhew therby the great forgetfulneſſe of

               <hi>But I know well the wilfulneſſe of that kinde of people to be ſuch, as I ſhall not obtayne this ſuite of them. For, they be afrayd, leaſt the force, and ſtrength of the truth ſhould ouercome them, and make them yeald vnto vs, and to agree with vs. That is the cauſe of their roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, &amp; ſtorming, leaſt they ſhould heare vs, and of their ſhutting of their eyes leaſt they ſhould ſee the light which we bring vnto them, wherein they ſhew the litle aſſurance that they haue in their own fond reaſons. For, they dare neither vnderſtand, nor enter into diſputation, becauſe they know they ſhall ſoone be
<pb facs="tcp:3170:17"/> vanquiſhed. By reaſon wherof, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to Paſſe, that through their ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all manner of ſcanning, and ſif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of things by diſputation,</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>They driue diſcretion quite away,</l>

            <p>
               <hi>And becauſe they are bente to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, and vtterly to oppres ſuch as they well know to be innocent: they be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that their innocencie ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare: becauſe they deeme it a greater iniquitie to condemne the innocencye that is apparant, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth not to tryall. Or rather, (as I ſayde afore) they are afeard, that they ſhould haue no power to condemne vs, if they ſhould heare vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the inuectiue which <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius</hi> wrote againſt the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his time, who condemned the Chriſtians without hearing them. Which reaſon, I wil vſe againſt the impatient catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, deſiring them, not to ſhew them ſelues like vnto thoſe heathen men, in being ſo obſtinate, as to ſhutte their eares from hearing, and vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the doctrine which they ſo condemne, &amp; perſecute, without knowing what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3170:17"/> it contayneth. But if thoſe angry Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, which oppoſe themſelues as aduerſaries againſt our reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſo boldly condemn it, wold temper their choller, &amp; paſſions, with ſuch moderation, as to geue place to reaſon, and to ſet naturall diſcretion in due place and preheminence: Truely, I durſt make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iudges of this cauſe, and I am wel aſſured that they would iudge farre otherwiſe, than they haue done hetherto, or doe yet.</p>
            <p>And in deed, if the loue of truth haue any place in their harts (as I beleue it hath) I beſeech them, euen before God and for the truthes ſake, to vouchſafe to examine this preſent defence with ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led iudgement: and to conſider of it without affection. For, I proteſt vnto them, that I will vſe ſuch modeſtie in my wordes, as none ſhall iuſtly haue cauſe to accuſe me of rigor.</p>
            <p>Firſt, therfore, I preſuppoſe, that betwixt the Romiſh Catholickes, and the Proteſtantes, there is diſagreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of doctrine in many poyntes, yea, euen in the moſt principall, as I will ſhew hereafter.</p>
            <p>But yet neuertheles both the one and the other doe acknowledge gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
<pb facs="tcp:3170:18"/> the vnitye of the perſon of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> in two natures not confounded: The holy Trinitye, of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, and the holy Scripture of the olde and new Teſtament, and therefore they bothe may in this reſpect, be called Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s howbeit the one more aptly then the other, as ſhall appeare by that which I will ſay hereafter. Now, that wee may the better treate of the poyntes which are in queſtion, and that all men may the more playnly iudge thereof, we will diſtinctly examine the reaſons which are to be conſidered in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and are commonly alleaged on both ſides, for the mayntayning of the doctrine of either party: and ſo by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the contrary reaſons and alegations together, the truth will the more apparantly ſhew it ſelfe becauſe light is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt apparant and bright, when it is ſet nigh to his contrary.</p>

               <p>The three Maximes are theſe, The firſt is that <hi>that doctrine of Religion whereby God is moſt honored, is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> beſt.</hi> The ſecond is, that <hi>that Doctrine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which is beſt builded vpon the worde of God is the moſte auncient and true.</hi> The third is, that <hi>the Romiſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <pb facs="tcp:3170:19"/> cannot well accuſe that doctrine, of hereſie, which is approued by their own Canones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which three rules or maximes, be ſo cleere &amp; euident of them ſelues, that (in mine opinion) the day, or the Sun is not clearer. For, ſeeing that Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is no other thing, than the duty which we owe vnto God. It doth folow, that that doctrine which teacheth vs to yeld vnto him all dutye and honour, and to rob him of no part thereof, is a good, and true doctrine, and that there can be no better.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe it is certayn, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which is builded vpon the only word of God, ought not to be called new, but that we may rather ſay, that it is as olde as the world it ſelfe. In ſo much, that they which doe call it new, may not nor cannot ſo call it, in reſpect of it ſelfe, but onely in reſpect of their own ignorance, for to the ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that they vnderſtand not, is new. Neither is it to be douted, but that it is moſt true, becauſe that God (who is the author therof) is the truth it ſelfe, and the fountayn of light, and wiſdome.</p>
               <p>In like maner, I thinke that al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:3170:19"/> will eaſily graunt, that euen the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſteſt Catholickes of Rome, can not diſpence ſo much with them ſelues, as to accuſe that Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hereſie, which is approued by their own Canones, becauſe the Canones be authoryſed by the Popes themſelues. For, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of <hi>Gracian</hi> (from whence I intend to draw the moſt partes of the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which ſhalbe alleaged) were ratifyed &amp; authoriſed by Pope<note place="margin">The decrees of Gratian authoriſed by the pope</note>

So that to reiect and condemn the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, were as much in effect, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Pope, and all the Romane Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>But full well I know, that hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when I ſhall alleadge the Canons, thoſe paſſionate Catholickes will riſe vp, and ſay that there be other canons contrary to theſe, and truly I will not deny but that the bookes of the Canon law, are ful of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>traryeties. Yet dare I boldly ſay, and aſſuredly auow that thoſe Canons which I will alleadge in this booke, are of the beſt and moſt auncient of al the Canon law,<note place="margin">The old ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons are bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nevv.</note> &amp; which haue proceeded from the beſt ſprings &amp;

               <p>Hauing thus ſet downe theſe three Maximes (the truth whereof is eaſelie to be perceaued, by euery man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon capacitie, (yea euen of the groſſeſt ſort) I am now to apply them orderlye to euery particular poynt.

                  <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> OF PRAYER. The ſecond Chapter.</head>
               <p>THe doctrine of the profeſſors of the Goſpell touching prayer, is verye playne. Their opinion is in effect, that we ought to offer our prayers vnto God our maker, who is able inough to geue vs whatſoeuer we aſke, &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in harckening gentlye to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtes: Who alſo hath manifeſted his great goodnes, in giuing his euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sonne, to the end that by him, our manhoode might haue acceſſe to his Godhead.</p>
               <p>And therefore they ſay, that in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God our creator, wee muſte al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3170:20"/> vſe the credite and interceſſion of his Sonne our mediator, who may boldly goe to the Father becauſe he is God as he is, in the ſelfſame God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and being: and diſdayneth not alſo to apply himſelfe to men, and to be an interceſſor for them, becauſe he is man as they be.</p>
               <p>Nether is this manner of praying vnto God altogether diſalowed of the Romain Catholicks: but they wil needes adde thereunto, that we muſt haue alſo other Mediators and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſors to God the Father, and to Ieſus Chriſt himſelf: That is to wit, the heſaints and the ſheſaintes, which are many in number, &amp; in their times haue done many a faire miracle. For (ſay they) if a man would be a ſuiter to a king, in any cauſe, or to his eldeſt ſonne, he would not at the firſt daſh preace to their preſence, but goe to ſome of their ſeruants, or Lordes of their Court. And ſo it ſeemeth a thing very reaſonable and meete, that when a man is minded to pray to god for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, he go firſt to ſome of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſtial court, to purchaſe acces to god, &amp; to Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne by their meanes: and that to doe otherwiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:3170:21"/> were a kinde of diſpiſing of the ſaints who haue the charge from God, to pray continually for the Millitante Church, and euery particular perſon of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Truely, it is not to be denied, but that theſe reaſons haue ſome colour and ſhew of truth, if we ſhall iudge of God as of man.<note place="margin">We muſt not iudge of God as of man.</note> But hereunto the Proteſtants reply, that we may not iudge of God, as of a king, or as of another mortall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for there is great difference. God is altogether good, and inclyned to doe good: But men, (be they kinges or other) are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euill, and diſpoſed to doe euill, both againſt God &amp; their neighbors. God vnderſtandeth our Prayers aſſoone as they be conceiued in our harts, and before our mouthes doe vtter them: But to cauſe a king to vnderſtande our ſuites, we muſt put them in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or tell them by word of mouth: and therfore we haue neede of Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to lay forth our caſes, &amp; of Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of requeſtes to preferre our peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Prince or to his councell, and of the fauor of great Lordes and councellours, to get vs audience and diſpatch. All which thinges haue no
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3170:21"/> place with God. So that to compare the maner of praying vnto God, with the preferring of ſuits vnto Princes, is a token that we ſlenderly conſider the greatnes of God. And here wee haue to note a proper ſaying of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amb. in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. ad Ro. c. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> which he vttereth in theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe wordes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe which in ſteede of reſorting vnto God, repayre vnto creatures, are wont to colour their contempt of God, with this miſerable excuſe. That by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of thoſe to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue recourſe they may attayne to the preſence of God, as men attayne to the preſence of a king, by meanes of his officers. But I pray you, is there any man ſo mad, or ſo careles of his owne life, that he dareth yeald the honor to any of the kings ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes or officers, which belongeth to the king himſelfe, ſpecially ſeeing we finde that ſuch as dare but ſpeake of the like matters, are by the law, gilty of high treſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? No. And yet theſe that yeld to the Creature, the honor that is due to the name of god, &amp; which letting god alone do worſhip their fellow ſeruaunts, think not themſelues blame worthy at all: as who ſhould ſay, they could reſerue any greater honor vnto God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Now the reaſon why men make their ſuites to Princes, by the meane and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor of Noble men, Captaines, and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, is, becauſe the king is borne a man, and knoweth not in whom to repoſe his truſt and confidence for the ordering of his publick affaires. But as for GOD, from whom nothing is hidden (for he knoweth euery mans deſertes) vnto him we haue no need of an Aduocate, but of a deuout hart. For whereſoeuer ſuch a harte ſpeaketh vnto him, he wil anſwere him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which ſayings this good doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> by good and apparant reaſons confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romiſh Catholicks touching the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Saints: So as, to vſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other mediator to Godward, than our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> is a diſtruſting of his fauor, and of the goodwill he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs, as though he were like vnto ſome rough and vncurteous prince, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wold take diſpleaſure if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preaced to his preſence, not being preſented by ſome officer of his court. For (ſay the Proteſtants) are not we certayn and well aſſured of the clemency &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our Sauior that doth inuite vs to come directly vnto him? Is not he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3170:22"/> our good Shepheard, our Redeemer, our attonementmaker, our reconciler and our brother? Wherfore hath he ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken vpon him our fleſh? borne our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities? fulfilled the law wherby we were condemned? ſhed his moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud? and ſuffered death and paſſion vpon the croſſe? Is it not for vs that he hath done all theſe thinges to purchaſe our ſaluation and reconci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liation with God his Father? For neither for himſelfe, nor to increaſe his own glory, needed he to humble and imbaſe himſelfe ſo much. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not to be douted, but that he doth diſcharge his office of Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, much better than all the ſaintes can doe: ſpecially, ſeeing that he is the only meanes that they be ſaints, and without him they could not ſo be.</p>
               <p>Now, as it is not to be douted, but he hath great good will to do the office of a Mediator for vs: ſo muſt we beleeue, that he will not conſent that any other ſhould take vpon him to doe it, but is and will be the onely obtayner of our ſaluation, and of the heauenly bleſſinges which God ſhall geue vs.</p>
               <p>Theſe be the reaſons which the
<pb facs="tcp:3170:23"/> Proteſtants do alleadge for the main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenaunce of their doctrine touching prayer. Whereby it doth plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that their doctrine is the beſt, according to our firſt maxime, becauſe that the honor which belongeth to Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord, is therby better, and more ſoundly and wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diminiſhing rendered vnto him, then by the doctrine of the Romiſh catholicks, who would haue ſo great a number of Mediators, as they ſeem to leaue to Ieſus Chriſt nothing els but onely the name of mediator, &amp; doe attribute to the ſaints, both the name and the effect.</p>
               <p>Secondlye, this doctrine of the Proteſtants, is perfectly grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word of God, as all men may know, by conſidering as well the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, as the examples which are in the bible, concerning prayer. For, firſt of all, the holy Scripture teacheth vs, to put all our truſt in the goodnes of God, and to pray onely vnto him, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring vs that he will geue care vnto our prayers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 7.18</note> ſaying: <hi>If you being euill, can ſkill to geue good thinges to your children, how much rather will your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, geue good things
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3170:23"/> to thoſe that aſke of him?</hi> And agayne, it exhorteth vs to vſe the credit of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Mediator to God the Father, ſaying: <hi>If any man haue ſinned we haue an aduocate with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> the righteous.</hi>

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.</note> He is ſaith S. Paul vpon the right hand of God, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth interceſſion for vs.</p>
               <p>And for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhould not abuſe our ſelues in ſeking many mediators vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to god: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcripture doth alſo teach vs, that as we haue but one God to whom we ought to pray: No more haue we but onely one Mediator ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>For there is but one God, and one Mediator betwixt God and man, the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </hi>

               </p>
               <p>And becauſe we ſhould not doubt that God is our Father, and that we may vſe him as a Father: we are taught that thoſe which beleeue in the Mediator, are made the children of
<pb facs="tcp:3170:24"/> god, by the ſame faith &amp; belief, ſaying: to all thoſe that haue receued him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12.</note> he hath geuen priuiledge to become the Children of God, that is to ſay: To thoſe which beleue in his name. So as <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf teaching vs how we ſhould pray to God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 6.9.</note> hath willed vs to call him our Father.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, in the Pſalmes of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, and in the other bookes of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble, there are infinite numbers of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, which proue that all holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue alwaies made their prayers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and neuer vnto dead me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor called vpon them to be their meanes and Interceſſors vnto God.</p>
               <p>Wherupon it followeth apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the doctrine of the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts touching prayer, is the moſt auncient and true, according to our ſeconde Maxime.</p>
               <p>Finally, the ſayd Romiſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks ought not to charge the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Proteſtants with hereſie, by the which they ſay, there ought to be no praying to the Saintes which are out of this world: for there is no man of ſo ſimple iudgement, but he will confeſſe it to be meere madnes, to pray to them which cannot heare him, as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3170:24"/> queſtionles thoſe which be dead can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vnderſtand the prayers which we make vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this world,<note place="margin">Sayntes can not heare the prayers that are made to them.</note> becauſe (as witneſſeth the Canon) they know nothing of the things which are done in this world, except (ſayth the ſame Canon) that thoſe which die, doe cary them newes of the things which they haue ſeene and vnderſtoode before their death. Theſe are the very words of the Canon.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>c. fatendum</hi> 13. 4, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>We muſt needes confes (according to the trueth) that thoſe which are dead doe know nothing of that which is done here vpon earth: but they may well be aduertyſed of them by ſuch as die and goe vnto them, and yet not of all thinges, but onely of ſuch thinges as are lawfull for thoſe that be heare to beare in memory, and expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the others to know.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus by this Canon, it is moſt euident that we ought not to pray vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to Saintes, ſeeing they be dead and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither heare nor ſee nor know any thing that we doe here vpon earth, but by meſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers. And who ſo ſhould ſay, that this doctrine is hereticall, muſt ſay alſo that the Canones and Popes be heretickes, which (as I take it) the Romiſh Catholickes will
<pb facs="tcp:3170:25"/> be loth to confes. This Canon is alſo confirmed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcripture, which beareth witneſſe to vs that there is none but god onely, that knoweth the ſecrets of mens hartes, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that it is he onely that can vnderſtand our prayers, which come rather from the hart than from the mouth.</p>
               <p>The proteſtantes ſay furthermore, that there are ſo greate numbers of Sayntes regeſtred in the Letany, of whoſe Canonyſing men doe doubte, (for as ſayth a good auncient Doctor, the bodies of diuers are honoured on earth, whoſe ſoules are buried in hel) that in reaſon we ought to refuſe the number of interceſſors, and contente our ſelues only w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ieſus chriſt, which is the true and pure doctrine that we ought to hold, and the Catholicks ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not iuſtly accuſe it of heriſy, according to our third maxime.</p>
               <p>And hereupon I adde this more, that as the proteſtantes doe hold opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that we ought not to attribute the title nor the office of mediator to any other tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Ieſus chriſt: no more ought we to do in his other titles and offices, as of his prieſthood, his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorſhip,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3170:25"/> his ſpirituall reigning, &amp; his chiefe ſhepheardſhip. For theſe be the titles of honor which belong vnto Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and are not to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to others, how great or excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perſonages ſo euer they be. And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly herein all the world muſt needs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that the proteſtants do ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to bee beſt Chriſtians, in that they attribute onely to our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the titles of honor that are his, and will not communicate them to any other creators, what ſo euer they bee, for if they would diſpence w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their conſciences in this behalfe, they know right well they might ſoone be at a poynt with the Romiſhe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and ſhunne many miſeries and perſecutions which they now indure. For there wanteth no more, but that they would allow the Sayntes to be partners of the title of mediator, &amp; the maſprieſtes to be parteners of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Sacrificers, the doers of good workes of Supererogation to bee parteners of the title of a propitiator, And the Pope himſelf, to be partaker of the title of Spyrytuall Kinge and ſoueraigne Sheaheard: And then by and by there would be a peace co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:3170:26"/> determined and eſtabliſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the proteſtants and the romyſh Cacholicks. But the proteſtants will by no meanes, nor for any cauſe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh any part of the titles of honor which belong vnto the ſonne of God, nor attribute them to any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Whereby it appeareth euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that men do them great wrong, in defaming their doctrine to the King, as though his permitting of them to excerciſe the ſame, were a mean to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſes him of the title of moſte Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian king.</p>
               <p>For in aſmuch as the name of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian commeth of Chriſt, out of doubt they be worthieſt of that name, which yeld Chriſt his due honor and glory.</p>

               <p>THe doctrine of the Romiſhe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes concerning faythe and good workes, differeth greatly from that of the Proteſtantes. For the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks hold opinion, that only faith without good workes doth not iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

               <p>That is to ſay, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith is the onelye inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wherby Ieſus Chriſt (who is the true and efficient cauſe of our iuſtification) applieth his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vnto vs, and maketh vs to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted iuſt before God his Father, through his owne merit, without the helpe of our good works.

               <p>For as touching the firſte poynte, you muſt conſider that the doctrine of the proteſtants doth tend, to attribute the honor of our ſaluation all wholly vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as vnto him, who is the true and onely cauſe thereof. For although we haue neede of fayth, whereby to receiue the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb facs="tcp:3170:27"/> of Chriſt, who imputeth and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his owne righteouſnes to all ſuch as beleue in him: yet neuertheles, he doth remain the onely and altogether true cauſe of our ſaluation, foraſmuch as it is he himſelfe, which doth alſo geue vs fayth.</p>
               <p>So as he doth not onely geue vs y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> drinke of immortallity, that is to ſay, his owne righteouſnes which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth vs, but alſo the cup to receyue it in: yea, and he geueth vs both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> freely and for nothing, but onely of his owne liberalitye and grace, with out aſking or receiuing of vs, any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for the ſame.</p>
               <p>And truely if we would goe about to recompence ſo great and excellent a benefit, as is euerlaſting life, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe our good workes: it were as much as if a man would purchaſe a great and rich inheritaunce, with a ſmale ſumme of bace mony, ſuch as in reaſon ſhould rather be cried downe, than allowed. For our good workes of themſelues, bee ſo vnpure and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, mingled with Ipocriſy and other ill affections, that they are not worthy to be preſented before the face of God, who doth not eſteeme ſuch
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3170:27"/> vntoward payments, in reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence of eternall life. Notwithſtanding, when they be done through fayth, hee doth accept them, in fauour and for good will to his ſonne our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> vpon whoſe only deſertes our fayth reſteth, becauſe in that reſpect, they proceeded from the good tree, which is <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> who worketh all our good workes in vs.</p>
               <p>So as the workes of fayth be good and acceptable vnto god, for that they proceed from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as from the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe which worketh them in vs; but they are full of vncleanes, &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be reiected, in reſpect that they proceed from vs, who ſerue but as in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtruments (howbeit yet vncleane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes) to do them. And therfore are they alwayes defyled &amp; ſpotted in ſome ſort: for <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> who worketh them in vs, doth make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good and pleaſing to God his Father: but yet they doe gather ſomwhat of the filthy and naturall infection of vs, who are the veſſels wherin they be made.</p>
               <p>Neuertheles, God is ſo good and gratious, that he not only admitteth them as done by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> his ſonne, but alſo for his ſake, doth wipe away
<pb facs="tcp:3170:28"/> the ſpots and vncleanes which are in them, and crowneth them with many bleſſinges: as with proſperitie of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, temporall wellfare, help of fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds in aduerſitie, moderation in proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, diſcretion, happy ſucces in affairs, &amp; with many other his benefits, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in he doth more and more ſhew his great bounty &amp; gratious goodnes by heaping vpon vs his bleſſings, as it were in recompence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good works which he himſelf hath wrought in vs, and in making vs to reap the fruit of his own labor, and to receyue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which he himſelf hath deſerued.</p>
               <p>But touching the great and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible benefit of the gifte of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and of knitting vs vnto him ſelfe in euerlaſting happines, he doth not geue it vs in any other reſpect, or conſideration, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only for the loue of his welbeloued ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> That was the cauſe why he wold haue him to come down into this baſe world, and to take our nature vpon him, and to fulfill the law for vs, and to beare our iniquities and greefes, and (at a word) to be our Mediator, our redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, our high prieſt, our Shepheard, and our ſpirituall king.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:3170:28"/>
               <p>All which titles he hath taken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to ſaue vs and to be the onely cauſe of our euerlaſting felicitie, and to knit and incorporate vs vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to make vs partners for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of his heauenly glory.</p>
               <p>Yet may we not hereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that we ſhould not doe good workes, as though they ſtoode vs in no ſtead to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for they be fruits of faith: and whoſoeuer hath the true faith, doth incontinently ſhew it by the good fruites and effectes which it bringeth forth in him.</p>
               <p>And he that doth no good workes, cannot ſaye that hee hath true fayth. Beſides that, we alſo are ſufficiently led to doe good workes, by the great number of other benefites and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinges wherwith God crowneth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as we haue ſayd before. This is the ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of the doctrine which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants do hold concerning faith and good workes.</p>
               <p>Whereby they yelde wholly vnto God, and to our Sauiour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> the honour which belongeth to hym, as to the true &amp; onely cauſe of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; of all the good things which we haue and receiue, aſwell Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all as Temporal whatſoeuer they be.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">We are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued only by God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any help of our ſelues.</note>It followeth then acording to our firſt Maxime, that this doctrine is better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doctrine of the Romiſh catholicks, who affirme that by theyr good works, they deſerue Paradiſe, &amp; all the other good things which God geueth them: &amp; that theſe good works do partly proceed of themſelues, and of their owne free will, and partlye of Gods grace: as if God alone coulde not ſaue them, if they helped not the matter by their owne good workes, which they hold to be part of the cauſe of their ſaluation: which doctrine all men may eaſely perceiue to be repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the nature of God. For ſeing that he is altogether and perfectlye mercifull: it muſt needes follow, that thoſe that be ſaued, be ſaued wholly (and not in part) by his onely mercy: which ſhould not be perfect, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effect thereof were not perfecte and entyre. Notwithſtanding, the Catholickes holde opinion ſtill, that their good workes are part of the cauſe of theyr ſaluation, and that they be not ſaued by the onely mercy of God.</p>
               <p>Yea there are monkes which take themſelues to haue ſuch aboundance of good workes in ſtore, that they not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3170:29"/> onelye haue ynow wherewith to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite their owne ſaluation, but alſo a great maſſe of ouerplus (which they cal works of ſupererogation<note place="margin">Workes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant or of ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>) to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the ſaluation of other men, but chiefly of ſuch as do them good, and geue them liberally of their temporall goods: which doctrine (in very truth) all ſuch as loue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of God ought to reiect. For it is an vtter defacing of the benefit of our lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; an attributing of the honor of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, to the vncleane works of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whereas in deed, we ought to attribute the ſame to the death and paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſon of god who is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is to be diſcerned by Gods word, which of the two doctrines is the trueſt and moſt auncient. For the Scripture doth playnelye teache vs, that we be iuſtified by fayth, without the workes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, &amp; ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by fayth onely, when it ſayth,<note place="margin">

               <p>Now, as there is no compariſon betwixt the deſertes of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> our ſauiour, and the deſert of mens good workes, no more than is betwixt the brightnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sun, &amp; a litle ſparke of fire: ſo muſt we needes confeſſe, that our conſciences do finde without all compariſon, far greater and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quietneſſe in the righteouſneſſe of fayth, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the righteouſnes of good workes.

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6.</note> S. <hi>Paule</hi> doth anſwere them thus: <hi>If it be of grace, then is it no more of workes, for then grace were no more grace. And if it be of workes: It is no more of grace, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were works no more workes.</hi>

                  <hi>when you haue done all the things that are commaunded you, ſay vnto your ſelues, we are vnprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uauntes, we haue done no more than we ought to do.</hi> Neither may we ſay, that Ieſus Chriſt doth commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vs to ſay ſo, to make ſhew of humility: for he who is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth it ſelfe, doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vs to lye for any intent, good

               <p>Dauid alſo doth witnes that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liuing can be iuſtified before God. And therefore it may bee rightly ſayd to theſe iolly doers of works of ſuper erogation, as Chriſt ſayd to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I knowe right well, there are many textes in the holy Scripture to proue, that who ſo will enter into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life, muſt keep the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of god, and that thoſe which haue kepte the commaundementes, ſhal poſſeſſe the kingdome of heauen: and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe which haue not kept them ſhall goe into euerlaſting damnation.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3170:31"/> But it is not to be inferred vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe textes, that a man may be inſtified by his good workes, for no man at any tyme doth performe Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements to the full: But euen the beſt of all doe breake them euery day many times. For what man is ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant as to challenge to himſelf ſuch ſincerity of life, that he loueth, and hath alwayes loued God with all his hart: and his neighbour as himſelfe, or hath not wiſhed ſomewhat that was an other mans?</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, there needeth no great diſputation vpon this poynt: for our conſcience doth here accuſe vs, and of it ſelfe condemne vs.</p>
               <p>Now then, if no man can fulfill the commaundements, It followeth that no man can haue euerlaſting life by his owne workes, but muſt ſeek ſome other iuſtification than by workes, if hee will be iuſtified before the face of God. And in ſeeking an other iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, he commeth to the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of fayth, which is by imputation, through the free beſtowed benefite of Chriſt. For, like as if a poore detter that were vnable to pay, were kept in priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a det of ten thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d crowns,
<pb facs="tcp:3170:32"/> and his creditor ſhould tell him, that if he paid the debt, he would ſet him at liberty, or els he ſhould rot in priſon: he had no redier remedy, than to get ſuch a ſurety, as would be ſo fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and frendly to him, as to pay the det for him, without truſting to his own ſubſtance, which is vtterly vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcharge ſuch a dette. In like ſort, man, knowing on the one ſide, that without performing the Law throughout, he is in danger of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: and on the other ſide, that he is not able to perform it, hath no other ſhifte, but to repaire to <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> to take holde of his righteouſneſſe by faith, to the end that the ſame may be imputed vnto him, and that by this meanes, his ſinnes may be wyped out, and himſelfe made capable of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life.</p>
               <p>And as it may truely be ſayd, that that detter hath well payd his dette, when his ſurety hath payd it for him: euen ſo may a Chriſtian ſay, that he hath kept and fulfilled the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God, when he doth aſſure himſelfe through faith, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath fulfilled them for him. Thus ſhould be vnderſtoode thoſe textes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3170:32"/> which inioyne vs to obſerue the commaundements, to haue therby e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life. And after that ſort we ſhould make them to agree with the textes before alleadged, which ſay that we cannot be iuſtified but by faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. By which ſaying, euery man of ſound iudgement may eaſely know, that the doctrine of the Proteſtants is builded vpon the pure word of God: and conſequently, that (according to our ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Maxime) it is the moſt true and auncient, and not to bee called new, but of ſuch as do not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it. Neither may the Catholicks call this doctrine hereticall, according to our third Maxime, becauſe it is ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, euen by their owne Canons.<note place="margin">c.

               <p>There is another taken out of S. Auguſtine, which ſpeaketh yet more plainly, ſaying thus:<note place="margin">c. Vt euiden ter. <hi>1.</hi> q. c.</note>

               <p>Which Canon doth ſhew playnly, that the merites of good workes, do no whit iuſtify vs: and ſo conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is fayth onely w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out works which is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> inſtrumentall cauſe of our iuſtification, &amp; the very efficient cauſe therof is Ieſus Chriſt, working by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt.

For my purpoſe is not to build the doctrine of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, neither vpon Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, nor vpon Canons: but onelye to rehearce and alleadge ſome of them, to ſhew vnto the Romiſh catholicks, that in condemning the ſame ſo bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of hereſy, by the ſame meanes they vnaduiſedly condemne their own ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and doctors. And becauſe they doe ſo greatly brag, that they hold the fayth of the Romiſh Church: I mean
<pb facs="tcp:3170:34"/> to proue that they do not ſo,<note place="margin">The au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient church taught no other doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine than that of the Apoſtles. <hi>c.

Harken now, what a Canon ſayth, in an Epiſtle written by Pope <hi>Marcell</hi> to the biſhop of <hi>Antioch. <hi>We beſeech you deere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued brethren</hi>
                  </hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teach nor allow any other doctrine, than that which you haue receiued of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and of the other Apoſtles and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

               </p>
               <p>Hereby it appeareth, that the fayth of the Romiſh Church ought to bee grounded vpon the pure and onely doctrine of the Apoſtles our true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And that as many as intend to follow that fayth, muſt neither teach nor beleue any other doctrine.

               <p>I Haue could you here before, that the Romiſhe Catholickes and the Proteſtantes, doe diſagree about the defining of good works. For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thoſe onely to be good workes, whch concerne the obaying of Gods commaundements. But the Catholicks do not onely recken thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:3170:35"/> to be good works, which concern the obaying of the commaundementes of God, but alſo thoſe that concerne the obaying of the traditions &amp; comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Of which traditions (ſay they,) ſome haue bene inſtituted by Ieſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And becauſe there is no mention made of them in the holy ſcriptures, they haue recourſe to a diſtinction inuented by the Sophiſters, ſaying y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there are two ſortes of the worde of God, the one written, and the other vnwritten.<note place="margin">The ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters make a double worde of God, the one written and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not written.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And vnder this kind of the vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten word of god, they would compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the moſt part of their traditions. But this diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is very eaſely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: Namely, that thoſe traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they call the vnwritten word of God, (as holy water, Lent, the worſhiping of the croſſe, the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of altars, and ſuch other like) be repugnant to the written word of God: And that if there be any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written word of God, the ſame can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee repugnant to that whych is written, as theſe traditions be.</p>
               <p>Alſo, it is to bee found by the wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Hiſtoriographers and other
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3170:35"/> Authors, who they were that firſt did ſet forth ſuch traditions: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not to be fathered vpon the vnwritten word of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is not to be denied, but that the written word of God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and ſufficient to ſaluation: And therfore that no article of fayth ought to be fathered vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnwritte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word, but only (at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt) ſome ſuch points as concerne the order and gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Church. But yet vnder prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the ſame diſtinction, the Papiſtes thinke that to ſay and heare Mas, to ſing and ſay Suffrages for the dead, to geue legacies and Offerings vnto Prieſtes, to goe on Pilgrimage to Saints, to offer Candles vnto them, and to fall flat before the Images of them, to abſtaine at certayn times in the yeare from eating of fleſh, to liue ſolitarily within a Cloyſter, and to weare their Garmentes after ſome ſtraunge faſhion, and other ſuch like things, be good workes, and merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to gayne Paradiſe. And the reaſon why they doe recken all theſe thinges to be good works: is partlye becauſe they do pretend that god hath commaunded them by his vnwritten
<pb facs="tcp:3170:36"/> word, (as before is ſayd:) And partly, for that (ſay they) it is a work of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, when one doth not onely all that which God commaundeth, but alſo more than he doth commaund. For, by this meanes they do ſo abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in good works that many of them do more than are needfull to ſaluation, &amp; may therfore ſpare ſome part of them to other good Chriſtians, which do to few, in recompence of their temporall gooddes which they receyue of them. But hereunto the proteſtants do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that it is ſufficient for a man to do the commaundements of God w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out charging himſelf farther, ſith ther yet was neuer man, that could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them throughly, much leſſe doe more. Notwithſtanding, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants graunt it to be true, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly men doe more than they are commaunded: but their ſo doing is but ſinne, and in the mean while they leaue the commaundementes of God vndone. And therefore, this doing of more than God commaundes, is not ſo great a vertue, as the Romain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes eſteeme it to be.</p>
               <p>For, ſeeing it is not to be denyed, but that the commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements of God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3170:36"/> are perfect, as the Author of them is perfect: ſo it muſt needes follow, that they comprehend al good works, and ſo conſequently that all ſuch workes, as are repugnaunt to the worde of god and hys commaundementes, are not good.</p>
               <p>Agayne, it is good reaſon, that we ſhould eſteeme all things to be good, whiche God commaundeth, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thoſe thinges for ill, which hee forbiddeth, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out going any farther. For it is he that hath ſet the difference betwixt good and ill, and betwixt vice and vertue, and which hath imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the knowledge thereof in mans vnderſtanding, euen from hys creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By reaſon whereof, whereas we deeme it good, to honour one God, to loue our neighbor, &amp; not to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then we woulde be done vnto: theſe &amp; ſuch lyke do proceed &amp; depend vpon the ordinaunces of God,<note place="margin">The deſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of good works dependeth vpon Gods ordinaunce.</note> which hath ſet that order, and diſtinction in the things of the world.</p>
               <p>So as by conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, vertue is good, and vyce is yll, becauſe that God hath ſo ordained, &amp; ſtabliſhed that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the nature of men. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot call thoſe good works
<pb facs="tcp:3170:37"/> which appeare not to be good works by his word and ordinaunce: neither may mans iudgement ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume of it ſelf, as to terme that a good thing, which he is not ſure to be ſo, by the ordinaunce of God. For, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that God ſhould allowe thoſe things for good, which our fancy dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be good, without hauing any warrant thereof by the ordinaunce of God: were an imbaſing of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor beneath the Creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">By the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Pope, the richmen may better gayne Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe then the pore ſort.</note>Moreouer the proteſtants do ſay, that if a man might win heauen by theſe pretended good workes (as the Romiſh Catholickes hold opinion:) it would then be much more eaſy for the rich men to attayne to it, than for for the poore. For the rich haue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherewith to cauſe Maſſes to be ſayd, and to be liberall in giuing to prieſtes, and to mayntayne long ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys on pilgrimage, and to buy good fiſh that they may the better forbeare fleſh in the lent tyme, and to doe ſuch other like workes.</p>
               <p>So as by this reckning the gates of heauen ſhould be open to the riche, and ſhut againſt the poore: by reaſon whereof, the wealthy men ſhould bee
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3170:37"/> happy both in this worlde and in the world to come: and on the contrarye part, the poore ſhould bee vnhappy, but that were agaynſt reaſon. For cleane contrariwiſe, it is certaine that heauen is open rather to the poore than to the rich, and that it is a harde thing for a rich man to enter into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
               <p>And therfore the inuention of theſe pretended good workes (whereof doe follow ſo many &amp; greate abſurdities) is in no wiſe to be allowed: But wee muſt holde our ſelues to the onely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinancee of God, to whom we ought to yeld ſuch honor, as to beleue that onely thoſe be good works, which he alloweth for good by his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and that thoſe are not good works, which he alloweth not. For in ſo doing we ſhall follow the beſt doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which yeldeth God his honour due vnto him.</p>
               <p>As concerning the other ſort, It is eaſy to be proued by one onely argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which cannot be gaynſayd, that thoſe workes which are not agreable to the commaundements of god, and to his word, are ſin: &amp; then muchleſſe are they good workes. For al workes that are done without faith are ſinne,
<pb facs="tcp:3170:38"/> ſaith ſaynt Paule becauſe it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe God without fayth.<note place="margin">

Whereupon it followeth playnly that thoſe workes which haue not theyr foundation in the worde of God, are ſinne, and ſo by conſequence are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth.</p>
               <p>And therefore it ſtandeth the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne Catholickes in hand, to ſhewe that their pretended good workes are allowed by the word of God, if they intend to proue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be good works in deed: Which thing they cannot doe. Nay rather clean contrariwiſe, a man may well proue that the ſcripture co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth them As touching the mas, purgatory, and praying for the dead, we will ſpeak of them els where, and ſhew that the doctrine of the Romiſh Catholickes in thoſe pointes, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the word of God.</p>
               <p>As for pilgrimages, ſeeing the end of them is to pray vnto Saints, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that they alſo are condemned by the worde of God, which teacheth vs to call onely vpon God, by the meanes of Chriſt our Mediator, as we haue ſhewed before. Likewiſe, to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3170:38"/> knele down before Images of ſaints, and to make offeringes vnto them, is condemned by the ſecond commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, which forbiddeth all kinde of Images, or to do vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any kinde of honor or ſeruice.</p>
               <p>As touching monaſticall vowes,<note place="margin">Vowes of pouerty.</note> which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt in purenes, chaſtity, and obedience. It is alſo very eaſy to bee proued, that they bee ſuch workes as are diſalowed by the word of God, at the leaſt, in ſuch ſort as the cloyſterers do vſe them. For, as for pouertye the moſt part of them haue but the viſor therof: for euery body knoweth, that the fayreſt, and richeſt poſſeſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto their Monaſteries. And the prouerb which ſayth, <hi>(he is as fatte as a Monke,)</hi> doth wel ſhew, that pouerty hath no harbor among them. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that ſome of them (as the begging friers, called alſo Limiters) make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of wilful pouerty in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and that they liue altogether by begging, yet is not that vow of theirs allowed of God For, firſt of all,<note place="margin">Deut. 15.4.</note> God forbiddeth men to beg, and therfore in begging, they breake his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. I know they will hereunto reply, that they be forced to make ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
<pb facs="tcp:3170:39"/> a vertue to liue by, becauſe that otherwiſe, they ſhould ſtarue for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ſo be murtherers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, wherin they ſhould breake the commmaundement of God, which forbiddeth to murther.</p>
               <p>But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> anſwere hereunto is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their vow of pouerty hath brought them to both thoſe two extremities, that is, either to beg, or to ſuffer themſelues to die for hunger. And becauſe in both theſe caſes, there is a working againſt the commaundement of God, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that that vow is nothinge worth, foraſmuch as it leadeth them to the offending of God.</p>
               <p>And, to ſpeake of their vow of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie,<note place="margin">The vow of chaſtity.</note> which conſiſteth in not being marryed: the ſame is alſo repugnant to the word of God. For, God hath deliuered vs this generall rule, from the creation of the world, that it is not <hi>good for a man to be alone.</hi>

               <p>And therefore Saynte Paule
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3170:39"/> commaundeth all thoſe which haue not the ſpeciall gift of this chaſtitie,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note> to take wiues. The Monkes then, and all the Romayn clergie (of whom, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt a thouſand, there is not one that hath this gift of chaſtitie) doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly tranſgres Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, through this vow of chaſtitie, wherby they haue infected the whole world with all maner of whoredome, and villany. But herof we wil ſpeake more heareafter, in intreating of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>And touching the vow of obedyence<note place="margin">The vow of obedience.</note> it were very good, if they mente it of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandments of God. But they do not ſo vnderſtand it, (for to obſerue that vow, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neded not to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them ſelues from other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, nor to ſhutte vp themſelues in Cloyſtars.) But they refer this vow of obedience, to they precepts contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their own orders. The moſt part of which precepts, conſiſt in theſe poynts following. That is to ſay, In wearing of ſtrange faſhioned Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, much differing from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort: In abſtayning from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn kindes of meates: In occupying themſelues in contemplations: And

               <p>For, as touching the Monkiſhe weede, we finde not, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> or his Apoſtles, were apparrayled af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any other faſhion, than other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is therfore playn, that the diuerſity of the faſhions of Monkes garments was the deuice and inuention of thoſe who were the firſt founders of their orders, and therfore is not allowed of God.<note place="margin">

And firſt, as touching their garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, the Canons doe curſſe and ban all ſuch as repoze any holynes in them.<note place="margin">The habit of Moonkes hath no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines in it.</note> So that by the ſayinges of thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, we ought to abhorre all kind of Moonkes: For all of them accompt themſelues to deſerue ſomewhat at Gods handes, by theyr wearing of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kind of apparell, and of thoſe ſhirtes of heare next their ſkinne: and that they ſhould do ill, if they ſhould wear ſuch garmentes as other men doe. Theſe wordes here following be the very wordes of the Canon, which is
<pb facs="tcp:3170:42"/> a chapter of the counſell <hi>Grangrene. <hi>If any man thinke him ſelfe to be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter furthered to chaſtity, by his wearing of the Moonkes cowle, or take himſelfe to be the more righteous for it, and ther upon holde ſcorne of ſuch as modeſtlye weare hoods and other attyres after the common faſhion, Curſed be they.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>And touching their vow of abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from meates, the auncient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons ſpeake thereof in ſuch ſort, as generally they alow of ſobriety, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſcribing of any abſtine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, more from fleſhe then from fiſhe, Theſe be the expreſſe words of the Cannon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For there is nothing ſo delectable, as meates well dreſt and digeſted, Nor any thinge better for our health, or for the ſharpning of our wits, or for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of our bodyes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſicknes, than ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and moderate feeding: for as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance nurriſheth vs, ſo doth it alſo main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne vs, in good plight and pleaſures:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Canon it appeareth, that moderate dyet is ſo commended, as that wee muſt haue a regard to our health, and not appayre it eyther by to much pyning of our ſelues, or the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of meates that are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to our health.

               <p>Vppon this poynt of abſtynence from meates this hiſtory which <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> reciteth is worthy to be noted.

               <p>
                  <hi>For in auncient time, the Romayne Churche did make their lent of three weekes and no more. And all <hi>Greece Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uonia,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> made it of ſixe wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. And neither the one nor the other did make their lent of fortye dayes, as it ought to haue bene in following the ſignifacatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the word. Moreouer ſome of them did abſtayne from all thinges that had life: Other ſome did eate onely fyſh: And ſome others (which were not of the groſſeſt diet) did feede onelye on flying ſoules and fiſh, and did eate ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beefe, Mutton, nor other ſuch gros
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3170:43"/> fleſhe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were ſome other ſo ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, as they would eate neither egs nor whitemeate. And others, which were not ſcrupulous at all, did eate of all kindes of meates, ſauing that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the faſting dayes, they would not eate til late towards night. All which diuerſities (ſayth the hiſtorye) were in thoſe dayes practiſed in ſundrye chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, without finding any faulte, or chalinging one an other for ſo doing. Wherby it appeareth, that the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans which liued in thoſe dayes, were of much greater modeſtye, than thoſe which haue liued in our dayes, in whom we haue ſeene all kind of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, in burning and perſecuting of ſuch as haue not followed the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſuperſtitions that are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the Romiſh Church.</p>

                  </note> It is nothing

               </p>
               <p>And as touching contemplation (whereby the Moonkes woulde cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and mayntayne their idle life,<note place="margin">The Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of olde time did la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor for their liuing. <hi>C.

                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:3170:44"/> ſo little allowed and lyked of pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as that they be very ful of huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordinances, for the well gouerning of the goods and riches belonging to the Monaſteries: Inſomuch that there is a Canon, which condemneth a certayne kinde of people for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, which tearmed themſelues A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall, (as followers of the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Apoſtles) in making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to haue nothing priuat of their owne. And therfore, by this Canon, a man might ſay that all beggers are heretickes.</p>
               <p>And who doth not ſee the infinite number of abuſes, which are crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the order of Monkes in protes of time, againſt the ordinances of the Canones. <hi>For,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. Si cupit. &amp; C. Placu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it. 16. q. 1.</note> (ſaith the Canon) <hi>if thou deſire to be a Monke, that is to ſay a ſolitary perſon, as thou doeſt name thy ſelfe: What doeſt thou in the Citie, which is no place for ſolitary people, but for ſuch as ſhould haunt company?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And another Canon following, ſaith thus: <hi>Let the Monke be contented with his Cloiſter. For like as a fiſh doth die as ſoone as he is out of the water, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo doth a Monke when he is out of his Cloyſter. Therfore, let him be ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb facs="tcp:3170:45"/> and hold his peace, for he is dead to the world but aliue vnto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet for all this, doe we not ſee how the Monks are planted in the beſt, and greateſt Cities, and in the faireſt places of them, and in exceding Princely and ſtately houſes, whereas in auncyent time, they were conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to dwell in wild fields, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtes, and in little Cabonets, builded in the corner of ſome Rock? Shal not a man meet them now, at all houres, in euery ſtreete, in markets, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding places, in Innes, in fields, in townes, and in Caſtles, in ſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing within their Cloiſters?</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Monkes in olde time, of what ſort ſo euer they were, did eate no fleſh<note place="margin">No Monke ought to eat fleſh.</note> at all, but followed the ordinance of the Canon, which ſayth thus: <hi>It is not lawefull for anye Monkes, eyther to eate, or to taſt of fleſh: Not for that we eſteeme the creature of God to be ill,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. Carnem de conſecra. diſt. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>but for that wee iudge it meete and neceſſary, that Monkes, ſhold abſtayne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fleſh, excepting onely thoſe which be ſick. Nowe then, if it happen that any Monkes breaking the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this auncient rule and cuſtome, dare preſume to eate fleſh, let him be ſhut vp
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3170:45"/> and kept as a cloſe priſoner, by the ſpace of ſixe moneths to do his pennance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See now, how the Monkes were brideled by their own Canons, but the moſt part of them haue ſince that time, broaken their bittes. For, now there are none, but the Monkes of the charterhouſe, the Celeſtines, and theſe new come Capuſmes, and Smoke Monkes, which will obſerue that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non: and yet their obſeruing of it, is (for the moſt part,) but in outward ſhew, and Ipocriſie.</p>
               <p>Truely, if there were no more but this to be found fault with, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of monkery, the matter were not great. For, chriſtian libertie geueth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man leaue, to vſe all kinde of meates, which God hath created for mannes vſe, ſo that he take it mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly, with thankes geuing. But the cauſe, that led me to ſpeake of this point among the reſt, is to ſhew, that the Monkes of theſe dayes, doe not obſerue their auncient Canons.</p>
               <p>And by the Canons alſo,<note place="margin">C. Sanctim. 20. q. 1 Of Nuns.</note> in aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time, it was vnlawfull for any Nun to take the vaile, and to profeſſe her ſelfe a Nun, vnles ſhe were aboue forty yeres of age. But in theſe daies,
<pb facs="tcp:3170:46"/> they be forced to take it vpon them, being but thirteene, or fourteen yeres olde, whereof, the world ſeeth what good huſwifery inſueth. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the pouling of their heads whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take the black veile: it is not ſo ſmall a fault, as many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it to be. For, by the word of God,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.6</note> women are commanded to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue their heire in token of ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And according hereunto, it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by a Canon taken out of the Councell of <hi>Gangra,</hi> that any woman ſhould poule her head vnder pretence of Religion. Theſe are the wordes of the Canon.<note place="margin">C. Quecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que. diſt. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>If any woman cauſe her head to be pouled in reſpect of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, curſed be ſhe as a breaker of the Law of ſubiection, becauſe long heare is geuen vnto women to couer them withal, and to put them in minde of their ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas in theſe dayes, it is thought ſo ſtrange a thing amongeſt the Romiſh Catholicks, that a monk or a Nun ſhould marry,<note place="margin">That Monkes and Nunes may marry.</note> (becauſe it ſeemeth that in their ſo doing, they breake the vow of virginitie which they haue made vnto God:) they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare herein, that they haue not well read their own Canones, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3170:46"/> ſuch mariages are allowed: Namely, by one Canon taken out of S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> as a witneſſe of the Councell,<note place="margin">C.

But I ſay vnto you, that thoſe doe ſinne right greeuouſly, which doe ſeperate ſuch marryed folks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding, we haue ſeene many Lawes here in Fraunce, which haue diſanulled the maryages of prieſtes, Monks, and Nuns, and conſtrained them to returne to their Cloyſters, a thing quite contrary to this Canon.</p>

She was humble of hart, ſober in ſpeach, wiſe in vnderſtanding, of few words, geuen to reading, not put<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting her truſt in the vncertainty of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but in the prayers of the poore, earneſt in her worke, ſhamefaſt in her talke, ſeeking God and not man to be the iudge of her hart, not doing wrong to any, wiſhing well to euery body, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring all her elders, not enuying her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, void of boaſting, folowing reaſon, and louing vertue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hath this virgin at any time offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her Parents in word or deede? when hath ſhe beene ſeene to be at any iarre with her neighbors? when deſpiſed ſhe the poore? when mocked ſhe the lame? or when ſhrunke ſhe away from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? Her only care hath beene to haunte the company of ſuch men, as are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with mercy and honeſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtnes. There hath not paſſed her one ſuſpicious looke, nor dallying word, nor any vnſhamefaſt ieſture. Her pace hath not been vncomely, nor her voice loud, or ouer ſhrill. But, to be ſhort, her out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward behauiour hath alwayes beene the repreſenter and Image of the goodneſſe of her minde: for, a good houſe ought
<pb facs="tcp:3170:49"/> to be known by his entry, &amp; make ſhew at the firſt, that there is no darckneſſe in it, but that the Lampe which is within, doth ſhead forth his light to the outer partes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What ſhall I ſay of her moderate fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and of the great abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance of her duetifull doings? In the one, ſhe paſſeth Nature, and by the other, ſhe oppreſſeth it. She letteth no time ſlip, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome good. And her ſobrietie is ſuch, that ſhe doubleth her faſting daies, and when ſhe hath deſire to eate, ſhe ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth her meale of the firſt meat that ſhe meeteth with, which ſhe taketh alonly to keep her ſelfe aliue, and not to pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per her ſelfe for pleaſure. By theſe words the meaning of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> is not to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage maydens to vow virginitie, but to ſhew of what behauiour they ought to be, which haue already vowed it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hetherto I haue rehearſed the ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry words of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> who doth al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leage the forewritten ſentences of S. <hi>Ciprian,</hi> and S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to ſhew that they eſteeme not ſo much the vow of virginity, as the good behauior which ought to be in both thoſe, which be vowed, and in the others alſo. And it is to be noted, that in the ſaying of S.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3170:49"/> 
                  <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> aboue written (which ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the manners, dueties, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiors of the virgines which haue vowed virginitie) there is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of any of the hipocritical, and ſuperſtitious Ceremonies, which in theſe dayes, are obſerued by the Nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. He deſcrybeth them at large, and (as it were by peecemeale,) what they ought to be, &amp; in what ſort they ought to buſie themſelues, and wherein they ought to ſpend their time: and yet in all this, there is not one word ſpoken of their Popeholines. But contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, wheras he ſaith, that the vowed virgins, (which now a daies be called profeſſed) ought to be diligent in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, to beware of diſagreeing with their frendes and Neighbors, not to withdraw themſelues from the nedy, to frequent only ſuch men as are mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cifull, and ſhamefaſt, and to be of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and behauiour ſober, and not nice or wanton.</p>
               <p>It appeareth therby euidently, that in thoſe dayes, they were not ſhut vp in Monaſteries, but kept their vow of virginitie, in liuing in houſes of their own, or els with their kinſefolk, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing themſelues in all good works,
<pb facs="tcp:3170:50"/> of godlineſſe and vertue. And now that we haue ſpoaken ſufficiently of Nunnes, let vs returne againe to the Monkes.</p>

What ſhall we then ſay of the ſmokymonkes, the Ieſuits, and the Capuſſins, which are growen ſince that time.</p>
               <p>To conclude, neither the Monkes of old time, nor thoſe which haue been deuiſed alate, nor their vowes, nor their works, haue any ground in the word of God, neither doe they behaue themſelues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own Canons.</p>

For the proteſtantes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them (or els the Pope) to haue wiped out the ſecond commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which forbiddeth Images: and to haue cut the laſt commaundement into twaine, to make vp ſtil the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of tenne.</p>
               <p>And truely it is a great trechery, &amp; a preſumption vtterly intollerable, to haue bene ſo bold, as to raſe a whole commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out of the law of the liuing God. For if ye marke well the commaundements which the prieſts pronounce in the ſaying of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Maſſe: ye ſhal finde that Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the firſt commandement, (which is, Thou ſhalt honor but the one God, and loue him perfectly) they haue put the third commaundement, which is, Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vayne,
<pb facs="tcp:3170:51"/> and haue wiped out, and ouerſkipped the ſecond commaundement, which doth forbid to haue Images or to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor them.</p>
               <p>Whiche thing hath beene done of purpoſe by the Pope and his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, that they might the more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fill the temples of the Chriſtians vnawares, with Idols and Sayntes of both kindes, to draw vnto themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues offeringes and obuenſions, and other like thinges, as may be ſeene by the ſequel therof. So as in this point, the doctrine of the Romiſh catholicks is contrary to Gods word and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement: for God ſayth, Thou ſhalt make to thy ſelfe no grauen I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, nor the likenes of any thing, ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther ſhalt thou doe any honour vnto them.</p>
               <p>Contrariwiſe the Romiſh catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks vphold, that it is lawful to haue Images in Churches, (as they haue) and to knele before them, and to offer vp candles and ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe to them, and to put of their Cappes vnto them. Is not this I pray you, a direct encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of Gods ordinaunce, and a tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinge of it vnder foote, and a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of the creator of his due honour,

                  </note> that firſt their own canons, which alow the honoring and ſeruinge of Images, doe vſe the ſelfe ſame terme of worſhipping, <hi>ſayinge that Chriſtians ought to honor and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Images.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Secondlye becauſe this diſtinction of worſhipping and ſeruing is fond &amp; fooliſhe, chieflye in the Application, which they make therof. For they ſay that they honor God with the honor that belongeth to worſhipping, and that they honor the Saynts with the honor that belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to ſeruing. Now who is ſo very a foole, that he doth
<pb facs="tcp:3170:52"/> not perceyue, how by this meanes they humble themſelues more in their honoring of Sayntes, than in theyr honoring of god. For he doth more im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>baſe himſelfe which ſerueth, than hee which worſhippeth or honoreth. For as we commonly ſee, great lords can find in their hartes to honour meane perſonages, to whome notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they will not vouchſafe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte themſelues to doe them any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</p>

               <p>The Proteſtantes ſay farther that the catholickes haue ſo corrupted the fourth commaundement,<note place="margin">The Papiſts haue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manodeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> as that (by all likelihood) their meaning was to haue made it quite away, as they dyd the Seconde.

               <p>And the Romiſh Catholicks doe contrarywiſe ſay, that in ſome weeks wee ought not to labour paſt three or foure dayes, or fiue at the moſt, for the reſt (ſay they) of the ſixe ought to bee

               <p>I pray you tell me, is not this a manifeſt impugning of the ſacred &amp; inuiolable commaundement of God our creator? Is it not a ſetting of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues directly agaynſt his holy will? I know well it may be ſayd, that in the tyme of the olde law of Moyſes, they did make moe reſting dayes than the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th, which was called the Sabaoth day: As the feaſt of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, of Trumpettes, of vnlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uened bread, of Eaſter, &amp; ſuch others like. But the aunſwere hereunto is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch feaſts were commaunded by the expreſſe word of God. And bee not thoſe feaſts which are celebrated in the Romiſh Church.

               </p>
               <p>This Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth plainly condemn the doctrine of the Papiſtes, which hold opinion that men ought to do no
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3170:54"/> maner of worke vpon the Sundayes nor on the holidayes throughout the whole yere. The proteſtantes doe, (in deed) confeſſe, that the Sunday ought to be imployed rather in the ſeruice of God, than in any other kinde of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell. And that it is good to obſerue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> order, to the intent that by reſting on y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day, folke may be the better able to go through with their worke vpon al the other dayes of the weeke: But to binde mens conſciences to that order, were no better than to make them Iewes.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:3170:55"/>
               <p>And yet if now a dayes, any poore proteſtant ſhould labor ſixe dayes of the week in the fieldes, or in his ſhop to obay God and to mayntayne hys poore family: by and by they will cry out that he is an heretick, and worthy to be burnt or baniſhed. And why ſo? Is it hereſy to obay God? Now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when men vſe ſuch ſpeeches, is it not all one, as if they called vertue, vice: and white, black? Therefore let them hardily know, that their ſpewing out of ſuch ſpeaches, is agaynſt God himſelfe, who will one day well cauſe them to feele his terrible iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and make them know that hee is ielous of his honor, and a reuenger of the deſpight done to his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.

                  <hi>Of the Sacrament of</hi> Baptiſme. The vi. chapter.</head>
               <p>ALthough the Romiſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes holde opinion that there are ſeuen ſacramentes: yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to auoyd tediouſnes, wee will ſpeake here but of two: That is to ſay of baptiſme, and of the Lordes Supper.</p>
               <p>As touching Baptiſme, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes and the Proteſtauntes do well agree in the principal poyntes: which is, that it ought to be done in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy ghoſt, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſign of water.</p>
               <p>But they doe differ very much in the other poynts and ceremonies: for the Catholicks beleue that if a childe dye before he be baptiſed, he cannot be ſaued: and that in caſe of neceſſity, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may Baptiſe. And they woulde haue Baptiſme miniſtred with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured water, ſuch as had bene kept all the yere in a veſſell, (which they call a font) within the Churche: affirming that the euil ſprites be coniured to go
<pb facs="tcp:3170:57"/> out of the bodies of the little Infants which are baptiſed: And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they muſte be held all naked ouer the fonte in the tyme of the chriſtning, and that both ſalte and ſpittle ſhould be put into the mouthes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> babes: Al which things the Proteſtaunts do vtterly diſallow becauſe as touching the infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which die vnchriſtened, if they belong to Gods election, (which goeth both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their natiuitye &amp; alſo before theyr conception) they be with him and are partakers of his ſaluation, although they die vnbaptiſed.</p>
               <p>For Gods election cannot be diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted. Beſides this it is not their fault if they be not baptiſed, but the negligence of their Parentes, or by chaunce of ſoden death.</p>
               <p>And as concerning women, their ſect and nature doth exclude them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> publick charges, which onely belong vnto men. And therfore are they alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnmeete, either to preache in Churches, or to Miniſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. And touching the children of Infidels, it is not reaſonable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue them into the church to be mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bers of chriſt, vntil they acknowledge him to bee their heade, and make
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3170:57"/> cnofeſſion of their faythe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently be of conuenient yeares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that being borne of vnbeleuing Parents, they haue no warraunt or witnes, that they belong to the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God. Neither doe the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes allow the forementioned ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies: And their reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, for that they beleue that god is the only cauſe whereof and whereby we receiue the benefite of generation, and the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of originall ſinne in baptim, with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out the ayd of hallowed water, or of any of the other Ceremonies. Nay, which more is, they take it to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing of the holy baptiſme, to adde thereunto any other ceremonies then the inſtitution of God, &amp; that it ought to be miniſtred purely and ſimply, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ordinaunce. For wee ought to doe this honour vnto God, namely to beleue that whatſoeuer hee hath ordeined is perfect, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thereto there ought nothing to be added, nor aught taken away. And therefore it doth appeare, that in this poynte of Baptiſme, the Doctrine of the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes doth much better yeelde God his due honor then doth the doctryne of the Catholickes.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3170:58"/>
               <p>For the Proteſtantes mind not to reſtrayne the election of God to thoſe onely which are Baptiſed, but doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it to the children of the faythfull, foraſmuch as it is a thing very reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to be beleued, that if the fathers and moothers bee of the houſehold of God, their children are ſo likewiſe. But the Romiſh Catholicks do hold on the contrary, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the children whiche die before they be baptiſed, be not of the houſehold of God, although theyr Fathers and moothers were.</p>
               <p>Agayne, whereas the Catholickes enable women to baptiſe (which they call chriſtening<note place="margin">Women ought not to baptiſe children.</note>) in doing wherof they committe vnto them one of the chiefe charges in gods houſe, to wit, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring of the ſacrament wherby we be graffed into the bodye of Chriſtes church, and made the members of his bodye and meyny of his houſeholde:) The Proteſtantes will not graunt to admit women into any of the publick charges in Gods houſehold, ſpecially ſeeing that euen by the ciuill lawes, (which in that poynt agree with the law of nature) women be diſabled to take vpon them the executing of anye publick office, euen in the houſes or
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3170:58"/> dominions of earthly princes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer wheras y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> catholickes, (as much as in them lieth) not onely receyue ſuch into the churche by baptiſme, as are faythles and haue no knowledge of Chriſt, neither they nor their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, but alſo beſtow baptiſme vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bels after ſuch a maner as they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues haue inuented for it: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes cannot finde in their hartes to defile Gods houſe ſo much, as to receiue infidels into it, or to avowe thoſe to be the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of Chriſt, who haue no fayth in them, neither them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, nor their Parentes, for aſmuch as it were to vnſeemely a thing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow ſuch a one for a member of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as acknowledgeth not the heade there of.</p>
               <p>Finally, the Proteſtantes yeeld this honor vnto holy Baptiſme inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by God, that they will in no wiſe adde any thing to it beſids gods ordinaunce, nor defile it with ſpittle, oyle, ſalt, coniured water, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ceremonies, As the Romiſhe Catholickes doe.

               </p>
               <p>And by an other Canon it is well ſhewed, that wee ought rather to reſt vpon the Baptiſme of the couenaunt of fayth, than vpon the Baptiſme of water.<note place="margin">C. verus &amp;c Non dubito de conſecra. diſt. 4.</note> For it ſayth thus: <hi>The true bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme doth not conſiſt ſo much in the waſhing of the bodie, as in the beleife of the hart, as the apoſtolicke doctrine doth teach vs, ſaying: They make cleane their hartes through fayth.</hi> And in an other Canon going before, it is ſayed that a catholicke not Baptiſed,<note place="margin">A man may be a catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick when he is vnbap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tized.</note> (for it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3170:61"/> that one may be a catholick without being baptiſed) whiche hath an ardent zeale of deuine charity, is to be preferred before a wicked man that is baptiſed.

               <p>By which canon it is eaſy to iudge that wee ought altogether to depend vpon that which the ſacrament doth ſignifie vnto vs, and vpon the graces which god doth thereby geue vnto vs and not to ſet our mindes vpon a ſort of ſuperſtitious and vayn ceremonies as the Romiſh catholicks do in theſe dayes.

               <p>THe difference betwixt the Romiſh Catholickes and the Proteſtantes concerning the Supper of the Lord, doth conſiſt in three points. The one, in the naming therof: for, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes call that the keeping of Eaſter, which the Proteſtantes doe name the Supper of the Lord. But this diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of ſpeaking importeth not much, for both of them are ſtill a celebrating of the miſtery of our redemtion. True it is, that the Catholickes vſe the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking of the old Teſtament: according to the phraſe whereof, the feaſt of Eaſter (that is to ſay the paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer) was celebrated by the eating of a Lambe, which did repreſent Chriſt, in remembrance of the deliuerance of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3170:62"/> the people of Iſraell, whom God had brought out of the thraldome of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt. But the Proteſtantes vſe the manner of ſpeaking of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, whereby the holy inſtitution which our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> ordayned to celebrate the remembrance of his death and paſſion, and to make vs partakers of his body and bloud, is called the ſupper of the Lord. But we muſt not ſtriue about words, ſo it be knowen that to keepe the Eaſter, and to celebrate the Lords Supper, are at this day one ſelfe ſame thing.</p>
               <p>The ſecond difference (which is much greater) conſiſteth in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Sacrament. For, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes (at leaſtwiſe the ſchoolmen) vphold, that aſſoone as the prieſt hath ſpoaken the words of conſecration o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer one hoaſte, or ouer many, they change their nature preſently, and are tranſubſtantiated into the very body and bloud of <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> in the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame greatnes &amp; bignes that it was vpon the croſſe: ſo as the bread of the hoaſt is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no longer bread, although the color, and the taſt of bread remayn ſtill therin. Their proofe of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, that when our Lord <hi>Ieſus
<pb facs="tcp:3170:63"/> Chriſt</hi> did inſtitute his ſupper, as he gaue the bread to his diſciples, he ſaid vnto them: <hi>This is my body.</hi> And in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them the cup, he ſaid vnto them: <hi>This is my bloud.</hi> They proue it alſo by a Canon,<note place="margin">C. Ego. de conſt. piſe. 2</note> which beginneth thus. <hi>I <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringarius, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> which Canon ſaith in expreſſe wordes, that <hi>after the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, the bread and wine become not only ſacraments, but alſo the very body, and the very blo ud of Chriſt. And that the prieſt doth ſenſibly handle the ſame very bodye, and breake it. And that the faithful in eating the Sacrament with their mouthes, doe craſh, and cruſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene their teeth, the very naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Sauiour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And vpon this doctrine they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that we ought to worſhippe the bread of the ſupper, which they tearm the holy hoaſt. Becauſe (ſay they) it is the very body of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Christ.</hi> But the Proteſtants allow not this Tranſubſtantiation of the bread into fleſh, nor of the wine into bloud, nor conſequently, the worſhipping of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as though <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> were perſonally encloſed within the compaſſe of the boaſt. For they ſay, that euery Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called a Sacrament, becauſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3170:63"/> it is a ſigne of a holy thing. In ſo much that the outward ſigne is to be conceiued by the eye: and the thing ſignifyed (which is inward and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall) is to be conceiued by the mind: And that therfore in the holy ſupper, the bread and the wine are the ſignes which we ſee with our eyes &amp; receue with our mouthes, but the body and the bloud of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> be the thinges ſignifyed, the which we comprehend and receue by the mind, as true ſpirituall foode ordayned to feede the ſoule and not the body.</p>
               <p>Now, to receaue and eate this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall meate, and to cauſe it ſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt in our ſoules, which are ſpirites, as it may geue them ſuch nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as may make them liue euerlaſtingly like as the food it ſelf and our ſoules that receaue it are ſpirituall thinges: ſo muſt the eating therof be ſpirituall alſo. And to make this ſpirituall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to become effectual: we muſt not imagine that our ſoules are remoued from hence, and conueyed vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, nor that God leaueth his place in heauen, to come downe to vs heare below: for the minde of man doth wel execute his workes, though the thing
<pb facs="tcp:3170:64"/> that it worketh vpon, be farre diſtant from it. As for example: we ſee how it doth truely and effectually vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the thinges that are farre from it by diſtance of place, by meanes of the habilitie or power of reaſoning, which ſerueth it as an Inſtrument to ioyne it to the thing that it worketh vpon, how farre of ſo euer it be by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place. And euen as reaſon ſerueth the minde as an Inſtrument to couple it to the thing that it ameth at in vnderſtanding: euen ſo likewiſe doth faith ſerue the minde for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to receaue and take hold of the body and bloud of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> in the ſpirituall meate &amp; drinke: notwithſtanding that he be in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, on the right hand of his father, from whence he will not come vntill the laſt day.</p>
               <p>This ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of eating then, which is done ſpiritually by the meanes of faith, is no leſſe reall, than if it were done carnally by the mouth of the fleſhly body, becauſe the ſpirituall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the minde bee no leſſe reall and true, than the corporall and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actions of the body, which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued by the eyes.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:3170:64"/>
               <p>The third difference touching the ſupper, doth conſiſt in the manner of receiuing it. For the Catholicques (I alwayes meane y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcholedeuines) do hold opinion, that the lay people (that is to ſaye thoſe whiche are no prieſtes) ought not to communicate, but only with the ſacrament of bread, And that the prieſtes (as beyng more worthy) ought to communicate both with bread and wine. And yet leaſt the lay people ſhould be difcontented with this partage, they ſay that the body of Chriſt is not without bloud, but that the bloud doth alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the body, and that ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoquence, the lay people in receiuing the ſacrament of the body, receiue alſo the ſacrament of the bloud. They hold opinion alſo, that the prieſt ought to receiue this holy ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t euery day: And that it is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the lay peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to receiue it once a yeare, and that it is not ſufferable that they ſhoulde touche the ſacrament with their bare handes. But the Proteſtantes do in no wiſe allow ſuch parting of it, nor yet their fond ſhift of conſequency, but hold opinion that the holy ſacrament (as wel of the bloud as of the body of
<pb facs="tcp:3170:65"/> Chriſt) ought to be diſtributed vnto all the faythfull, without any diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of lay people or prieſtes, becauſe that otherwiſe the ſupper of the Lord ſhould not be celebrated whol, but by halfedeales: And therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is good and neceſſary to receiue it as often as they may, that men may be the oftner put in minde of the excellent miſterye of our redemption, and be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the heauenly foode whiche geueth euerlaſting lyfe to our ſoules. Likewiſe they ſay that in aſmuch as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſayd, <hi>Take ye</hi> (which is referred to the hand) and <hi>Eate ye</hi> (which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth): the faythful ought to receiue the Sacrament into their owne handes, and the cuſtome of the Primitiue Church was to receiue the ſacrament with their owne hands,<note place="margin">Eccle. hiſt. lib. 6. cap. 33</note> as witneſſeth <hi>Euſebius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee in effect what the doctrine, aſwell of the proteſtantes as of the catholiques is, concerning theſe three poyntes of the ſupper of our Lord, whiche are in controuerſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt them.<note place="margin">Abſurdities that follow Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatiation.</note> And now may a man eaſely iudge by comparing the one doctrine with the other, which of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth beſt yeld god his due honor. For
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3170:65"/> if the bread were changed or tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated (as the Catholickes tearme it) into the very body and bloud of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> it ſhould follow by their doctrine, that he ſhould come euery day down from heauen, to be handled and eaten of a Million of Prieſtes, and to be bruiſed and cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betwixt their teeth: yea, and that he might alſo be eaten of miſe, and gnawen with wormes, which are thinges to much againſt reaſon, and too too intollerable to be heard. For it were a thing very vnbeſeeming the maieſtie of the ſonne of God, to be ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly conueid through the hands, Mouthes, and Bellies of ſo many Prieſtes, full often foule and filthy both in body and ſoule: And that his precious body ſhould be ſubiect to be eaten of mice, and gnawn w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> worms. And therfore the Proteſtants doe beſt yeald Chriſt his due honor, for that they vphold that his body is gone vp into heauen, and there ſitteth at the right hand of his father, and that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence he neither doth nor will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue, vntill the laſt day when he ſhal come to iudge both the quick and the dead. And therfore that our worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:3170:66"/> of him muſt be in heauen, and we muſt lift vp ovr hartes on high, and not worſhip him in the prieſts hands or in the pix. Likewiſe, they much more honor the ſupper of the Lord, than doe the Catholicks, becauſe they doe ſo often celebrate the ſame, &amp; that not by half deales, but wholly, vtterly abhorring the brooſing and cruſhing of the fleſh and bones of our Sauiour betwixt their teeth, as a doctrine more meete for the barbarous people of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> and the <hi>Canibals,</hi> than for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Neither will they (ſay they,) beleeue the contrary of that which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſence doth teach vs, that is to ſay, that the things which we ſee with our eyes, and taſt with our mouthes to be bread and wine, ſhould be fleſh and bloud. No nor that neither which is contrary to the order of Nature, namely, that accidents ſhould haue an abyding without a ſubſtance fitte and conuenient for them to be in: or that a naturall body of a man, may be inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſo ſmall roome as the bignes or roundnes of an hoaſt, for theſe things are contrary to nature. And if the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks reply that God is almighty, and able to doe theſe things: the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3170:66"/> doe anſwere, that doutleſſe he is of power to doe whatſoeuer he liſteth, In ſo much that becauſe God will neither ſinne nor lie: we ſay he can neither lie nor ſin. But our Lord meant ſo litle that his body after his glorification ſhould receaue vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall qualities: that cleane contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he would haue his Apoſtles to iudge by the ſence of their ſight and feeling, that his body was a true and perfect naturall body, and not an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined body. And although the effects of the Sacrament be thinges diuine, and ſupernaturall: yet are they not contrary to nature, as thoſe are which depend vpon the doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. Neither can it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the word of God, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments or any other of the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, conteine any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature.</p>
               <p>This doctrine of the Proteſtantes touching this Sacrament, is alſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently grounded vpon the word of God. For firſt of all, we doe ſay and beleue according to the articles of our faith, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is aſcended into heauen, from whence he ſhall come, not ten thouſand times a dry, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:3170:67"/> once at the laſt day, when he ſhall come to iudge both the quick and the dead. Which thing S. <hi>Peter</hi> declareth very openly, when (in ſpeaking of the laſt comming of our Lord) he ſayth thus:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21</note> 
                  <hi>Whom the heauens ſhall contein vntill the full ſetting of all things in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte ſtate, which God hath foretold by the mouthes of all his holy Prophetes, that haue beene ſince the beginning of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> himſelfe alſo did wel geue vs to vnderſtand, that we ſhould not beleue that his body after his aſcention ſhould euery day return hither on the earth, nor remayne ſhut vp in boxes, when he ſaid to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which found themſelues gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the ſhedding of a little ointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpon his body:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.11</note> 
                  <hi>You ſhall not haue me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with you.</hi> And yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we muſt beleeue, that by the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of his grace, he will alway be with vs, as he declared to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, in ſending them throughout the world to preach the doctrine of his grace, ſaying vnto them: <hi>Behold, I am alwayes with you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 28</note> 
                  <hi>euen vnto the end of the world.</hi> And we muſt furthermore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was made
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3170:67"/> in all points like vnto the bodies of other men (except ſinne) as the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do witnes:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.17.</note> In ſo much that it hath euer had, and ſtill hath at this preſent, a certain meaſure of greatnes and thicknes, as the bodies of other men haue. Wherupon it followeth of conſequence, that his body neither is, nor euer hath been, in any mo places than one at one time.</p>
               <p>And therefore when he celebrated hys holy ſupper with hys Diſciples, the day before he ſuffered hys death &amp; paſſion, his body which ſate at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, was not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread which he gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for the nature of a true body doth not permit it to be in any moe places than one at one tyme. And if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that a glorified body may be in many places at one inſtaunt: the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere thereunto is, that the body of Chriſt was not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> glorified but mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, at the tyme when hee celebrated hys holy ſupper, &amp; was put to death the day after,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 17.2.</note> and that the wordes of the holy ſupper ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not as now be true in any other ſort, than they were whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpake them and inſtituted the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. And therefore this replica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is impertinent, and beſides that
<pb facs="tcp:3170:68"/> it is vntrue:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.39</note> for the body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hath not through his glorification, loſt the qualities of a perfect body, whiche is to be felt, to haue fleſh and bones, and to be contayned within the compaſſe of certayne bowndes. And therefore when hee celebrated the holy ſupper, hys body was not in the bread which he gaue to hys Diſciples, and much les was the bread tranſubſtantiated into hys body. Whereof it followeth, that theſe words of <hi>Ieſus Christ, <hi>This is my body, This is my bloud,</hi>
                  </hi> ought to be vnderſtood ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally, as if he had ſaid, This is the ſacrament of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy &amp; of my bloud: becauſe that (as is a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>foreſayd) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of a very true body in deede, permitteth vs not to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that euery morſell of the bread which he gaue to his diſciples was his owne natural body. Alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words which S. <hi>Luke</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> vſe in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king of the Sacrament of his bloud,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.20 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25.</note> do well declare that it is ſo to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
               <p>For they ſay not that Chriſt ſayd <hi>This is my bloud:</hi> but rather this cup is the newe couenaunt in my bloud. Neuertheleſſe wee muſt thinke it all one with the other ſpeach, where it is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3170:68"/> ſayd <hi>this is my bloud,</hi> or els ſhould S. <hi>Luke</hi> and S. <hi>Paule</hi> be contrary to S. <hi>Mathew</hi> and S. <hi>Marke,</hi> which were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly to beleue So that if it be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as truth is) that to ſay this is my bloud, is aſmuch as to ſay this cup is the couenant in my bloud: It followeth playnely that this manner of ſpeaking, ought to be vnderſtoode of the ſacrament of his bloud, or of the ſacrament of the new couenant of his bloud, which is all one, and commeth all to one ſenſe.</p>
               <p>For the bread and the wine of the ſupper, are the ſacramentes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſte, and of the newe couenaunt which he maketh with vs: becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in receiuing this ſacrament with our mouthes, our ſoules do alſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate and receiue ſpiritually and re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ally, the thing ſignified, which is the body and bloud of Chriſt, in whiche participation conſiſteth the couenant which he maketh with vs.</p>
               <p>And in very deed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Io.</hi> 6.51.53</note> Ieſus Chriſt him ſelfe in ſpeaking to his diſciples of the eating of his fleſh and of the drinking of his bloud: (yea and of the ſupper it ſelfe as the Catholickes expound it,)
<pb facs="tcp:3170:69"/> perceiuing them to be offended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, tolde them that it ought to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of a ſpirituall feeding, and not of a cruſſhing of his fleſh and hys bones betwixt their teeth, nor of a ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niballike kinde of drinking of mans bloud, as the catholicke ſcholemen of theſe dayes do vnderſtand it. Neither ought it to ſeeme a more ſtraunge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of theſe wordes this is my body, to ſay, this is the ſacrament of my body, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of a great ſort of other figuratiue ſpeaches conteined in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture.</p>
               <p>As for example, where Chriſt ſayth <hi>I am the vine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10.9. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4 <hi>Exo.</hi> 12.43. <hi>Gen. 17.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12 <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.23.</note> 
                  <hi>and my Father is the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, I am the gate. And agayne it is ſayd the rocke was Chriſt, The Lambe is the paſſeouer, The circumciſion is the couenaunt, The ſacrifice is the clenſing of the law: and Chriſt is the church.</hi> For out of queſtion, all theſe textes are to bee interpreted figuratiuely. Thus may you ſee that the doctrine of the Proteſtauntes touching the holy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the ſupper, is grounded vpon the pure word of God.</p>
               <p>But now as touching the canons. The Catholickes thinke, they make
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3170:69"/> altogether for them, and for the vphol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding &amp; maintayning of their tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as in deed there be of them which do, and chiefly the canon before alleadged, which is an abiuratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that pope Nicolas cauſed to bee made at Rome, by one Beringarius<note place="margin">c. Ego Berin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>garius de conſec. dist. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> a deacon of the church of S. Mawrice of Angi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: by which abiuratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they inforced this poore man of Angiers to ſay and proteſt, that he renounced the doctrine that he had holden aforetime wherby he had maintained that the bread and wine of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t remained bread and wine ſtil after the conſecration, &amp; that the body and bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt could not be handled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the handes of men nor, eaten with their teeth: Declaring that contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he there allowed the doctrine of the Romiſh church and of pope Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas, that is to wit, that after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecration, the bread and the wine doe chaunge and tranſubſtantiate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into the very body and bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and that the prieſt in putting the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mouthes of the faythfull, doth ſenſibly handle Chriſtes very body it ſelfe, and that the faythfull doe crowze
<pb facs="tcp:3170:70"/> and craſhe it betwixt their teeth. But agaynſt this goodly abiuration rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by pope Nicholas and a hundred and fourtene biſhops out of this pore Deacon whom they helde amongeſt them in their clawes, there are many other cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to be oppoſed, which are of a better ſtampe. Thus ſayth one of them which is taken out of S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, wher he interpreteth theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the Lord,<note place="margin">c. Prima quidem de conſec. diſt. J.</note> 
                  <hi>The wordes which I haue ſpoken vnto you are ſpirit &amp; life:</hi> meaning of the eating of his fleſh and of his bloud. <hi>Theſe words (ſayth he) are ſpirit and life to thoſe that vnderſtande them ſpiritually: But to thoſe that vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtand them carnally, they are neither ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit nor life. You ſhall not eate this bodye that you ſee, neither ſhall you drinke the bloud which they ſhall ſhed that ſhall crucifye me: the thing that I commend vnto you, is a ſacrament: If you vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it ſpiritually, it will quicken you the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly vnderſtanding thereof auayleth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all.</hi> Afterwards he concludeth thus: <hi>The Lord ſhall be ſtill aboue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the end of the world, but yet in the meane while his truth ſhal remayn here amongeſt vs. For it muſt needes be that the body wherein he is riſen agayne, is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3170:70"/> in a place certayne, but his truth is ſpred euery where throughout the worlde.</hi> And to ſhew that the fleſh of our lord is not cruſhed ſo betwixt the teeth as Beringarius ſayth in his abiuration: here is an other canon taken alſo out of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which ſayeth thus.<note place="margin">c. Vt quid paras deute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. de conſec. dist. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>To what purpoſe dooſt thou prepare thy teeth and thy belly? beleue and thou haſt eaten: for to beleue in the Lord, is to eat the bread, and to drinke the wine, who ſo beleueth in him, eateth him.</hi> And an other Canon following ſayth thus. <hi>That which is ſeene and perceiued with the eies, is the bread and the cuppe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">c. Qui man ducant. de conſec. diſt. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>but as in reſpect of ſayth (which ſeeketh to be taught) the bread is Chriſts body and the cup is his bloud.</hi> And becauſe the receiuing of the ſacrament is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: It followeth, that at that ſupper the wicked receiue but the ſignes one<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, &amp; not the things ſignified, whiche are the ſpirituall meat of Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud.</p>
               <p>And the ſame is auowed by an other Canon which ſayth:<note place="margin">c. Qui diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordat. ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</note> 
                  <hi>He that agreeth not with Chriſt, eateth not his fleſh, nor drinketh his bloud, though he receiue the ſacrament to his vtter vndoing and damnation.</hi> By theſe Canons it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
<pb facs="tcp:3170:71"/> plainly that tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is reproued and condemned, and ſo by coſequence the locall worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the body of chriſt in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bread and wine. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I paſſe out of this matter. I will alleadge one text of S. Auguſtines,<note place="margin">Au. de doctr Chriſt. lib. <hi>2</hi> cap. <hi>10.16.</hi>
                  </note> which is ſo cleare and fitte to confute this tranſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as is poſſible. For firſt of all, (that men may learne to know what manner of ſpeaches in the ſcriptures are to be taken figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely and what are to be taken accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the letter) he ſetteth downe this rule which is a very notable one. <hi>If there be any thing (ſayth he) ſo ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Gods word as that it can not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree with the comelines of good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>

                  <hi>nor with the trueth of fayth: you muſt take the ſame to be figuratiuely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken.</hi> Afterwardes to make this rule plain by examples, he ſayth theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wordes. <hi>If then the maner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be a precept, ſo as it forbiddeth any crime and miſbehauiour, or commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the thing that is good, and behoue full: ſuch maner of ſpeaking is not figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue. But if it ſeeme to commaund an euill fact, or to forbidde the thing that is good and behouefull: then is it ſpoken
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3170:71"/> figuratiuely. Vnleſſe you eate the fleſhe of the ſonne of man (ſayth our Lord) and drinke his bloud, you ſhall haue no life in you. By this maner of ſpeaking he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to commaunde a cruelty and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill facte, in eating of his fleſhe and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his bloud, therefore it is a figure wherby we be commaunded to become partakers of the paſſion of our Lord, and to imprint gentlye and profitably in our memories, that his fleſh was ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled and crucified for vs.</hi> The Scripture ſayeth likewiſe. <hi>If thine enemye hunger feede him, if he be a thirſt geue him drink, no doubt but in this caſe he commaundeth a good deede. But wheras it followeth, for in ſo doing thou ſhalt heape coales of fire vpon his head: foraſmuch as thou mayeſt thinke that he commaundeth a malicious deed: doubt not but that this manner of ſpeache is figuratiue, and that thoſe wordes may be taken two manner of waies, the one to do hurt, the other to do good. Thou oughteſt therfore rather to conſtrue them according to charitye than otherwiſe: and by thoſe burninge coales, to vnderſtand the burning ſighes of repentaunce, wherby the pride of the party is healed, in that he repenteth him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf to haue bene an enemy to ſuch a one
<pb facs="tcp:3170:72"/> as releeueth his miſery and neceſſity. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it is written, who ſo loueth his ſoule ſhal loſe it. Now, It is not to be thought that he forbiddeth ſo requiſite a thing as the ſauing of a mans owne ſoule, but that this ſpeache ought to bee taken figuratiuely. He ſhall loſe his ſoule, that is to ſay, he muſt ſuppreſſe and forſake the froward &amp; vntoward dealing, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto his mind is now geuen: by meanes wherof he is ſo greatly wedded to theſe temporall things, that he hath no regard of the euerlaſting things. Agayn it is alſo written, Shew mercy and receiue not the ſinner. The latter part of this ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſeemeth to forbidde a good deed, for it ſayth, receyue not the ſinner. Vnderſtand therefore that this is ſpoken by a figure, taking the ſinner for the ſin, to the ende that thou admit not any ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus haue you heard the very wordes of S. Auguſtine, which doe very well declare vnto vs (as well by the rule as by the firſt example which he ſetteth downe) that the eating of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh and bloud of chriſt in his ſupper, ought to be vnderſtoode ſpiritually &amp; ſacramentally, and not after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the cannibals (which is vtterly voyd of all humanity and good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners)
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3170:72"/> as thoſe tranſubſtantiatiers would make vs beleue.</p>
               <p>And whereas the catholickes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,<note place="margin">The ſupper ought to be receiued in both the kindes.</note> that this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ought not to be diſtributed vnto the lay people but by halfes (which they doe terme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kinde) the ſame is expreſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:3170:73"/> are not to be taken for catholikes, which receyue not three times in a yeare. Theſe be the very wordes of a cannon taken out of the councell of <hi>Agatha.</hi>

                  <hi>The laye people which receyue not the Lordes ſupper, at Chriſtmas, at Eaſter, and at whitſontide, let them not bee taken ne reputed for Catholikes.</hi> Thus may all men perceyue &amp; iudge, with what manner of paſſion theſe catholikes are caried away, which do ſo boldly condemne the Proteſtants as heretiques for their doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this poynt of the ſupper of the Lord, and ſo do ſpitefully name them <hi>Sacramentaries,</hi> as though they denied this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

But in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dede it is nothing ſo: for the ſcripture hath but one ſence, which is eaſy to be found out of a man that is willing to

But the cannons are in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſes quite contrary one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I know full well that too ſhift off theſe contrarieties, the ſchole men ſay that we muſt always hold vs to thoſe that were laſt made.

For euery man of ſound iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment may always eaſely perceyue, that the ancient cannons are better than thoſe of latter tyme.</p>
               <p>And further, to abate the authority of their cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s by their cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues I ſay, that the cannons do will vs to ſerch the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the obſcure textes of the ſcripture, in the ſcripture it ſelfe, And thoſe which ſeeke it elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, are the very ſcholemaſters of errour.

               </p>
               <p>Which cannon in very deede, doth deeply in few wordes condemne the ſcholedeuines that make more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the authority of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cannons and doctors of the church, than of the very text of the ſcripture, which they accompt to be to obſcure.

Do they not by the ſame meanes, condemne the canons and auncient doctors? And if they condemne them: Are they to bee holden for good Catholickes?</p>
               <p>Well: let vs come now to ſpeake of the Maſſe.</p>

                  <hi>Of the Maſſe.</hi> The viii. Chapter.</head>
               <p>THe difference betwixt the Maſſe and the Supper of our Lord is great. For, the Catholick ſchoolemen which vnderſtand what the maſſe is, (for all of them vnderſtand it not) doe
<pb facs="tcp:3170:75"/> ſay, that it is a Sacrifice, whereby the Prieſt offereth vp the body and the bloud of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> vnto God, for the ſoule health, both of the quick and of the dead: Which Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is accompanied with diuers other parcels as acceſſaries: that is to ſay, with diuers prayers, and diuers texts taken out of the goſpels and epiſtles of the new Teſtament, and with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers verſes taken out of the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and other bookes of the olde Teſtament, and interlarded through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with many and diuers Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. And this goodly omnigatheru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath bene patched together at many &amp; Sondry tymes, by dyuers Popes. And that is the cauſe why the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes do put the maſſe among the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of their holy mother Church. For this commaundement, Thou ſhalt heare maſſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, and vpon other feaſtfull dayes inioyned, is the firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of the Church of Roome. But aſfor the ſupper of our Lord, It is no ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but an holy bancket, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to put vs in mynde of thonelye and ſoueraigne ſacrifice, whereby our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> himſelfe was once for
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3170:75"/> all ſacrificed for our redemption, and to make vs pertakers of his body and bloud, by the ſpirituall and effectuall eating thereof: So that there is noe more lykenes betweene the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Lordes ſupper and the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating of the maſſe, than is betwixt geuing &amp; taking, which are things far differyng, For, in the ſupper, the fayth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full receyue the body and bloud of Chriſt: but in the Maſſe, the Prieſt geueth, or offereth vp Chriſt wholly vnto God the Father, as an hoſt of ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>Now it muſt needes be graunted, that in this poynt of the Maſſe, the catholickes and the Proteſtantes doe vtterly diſagree, And that the ſame diſagreement is the principall cauſe, why the Catholicks do ſo extreemely bate the doctrine of the ſayd Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. For they eſteeme the maſſe to be one of the principall poyntes of the Chriſtian religion, and therfore think it very ſtraunge, that the Proteſtants ſhould be ſo bould as to reiect it, ſyth it hath dured ſo long tyme, and is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſo many good things, drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of holy Scripture, the whiche the Proteſtantes ſeeme to reiect, in reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
<pb facs="tcp:3170:76"/> the texts that are taken out of it.</p>
               <p>In deede theſe reaſons geue ſome likelyhood wherby to iudge ſo, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing the other partye. But if the Catholickes will vſe a little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and here the replies of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes: they ſhall not finde them ſo voyde of reaſon as they thinke. For firſt they ſay, that the onely ſacrifice, whereby Chriſt hymſelfe was ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced once for all, is more than ſufficient for the ſaluation of the whole worlde. Yea &amp; though he had ſhed but one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drop of hys precious bloud vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe: It had bene ſufficient to haue ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſfyed the Iuſtice of God his father, and to waſhe away the ſinnes of all men, which ſhould be borne into the world in an hundred thouſand yeres, if the world ſhold laſt ſo long, for that inaſmuch as he was the ſonne of god, the dignity of his prieſthoode and the infinite greatnes of hys Sacrifice, are of ſufficiency and worthines inough and more than inough, to doe away the innumerable ſinnes of all men he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto borne, or hereafter to be borne. And therefore it is great outrage (ſay the Proteſtants) to our Sauiour, to crucifie hym new agayne (as they do
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3170:76"/> in the maſſe) to obtayne remiſſion of ſinnes, and lyfe euerlaſting, for the quick and the dead for it is all one, as to ſay, that hys onely once ſacrificing of himſelfe, is not ſufficient to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our ſinnes, and to obtayne vs lyfe euerlaſting, becauſe that if they held it for ſufficient and perfect, (as in truth it is) it ſhould follow, that it were in vayne to do it any more.</p>
               <p>And is it not a great blaſphemy, to ſay that the oblation and ſacrifice of the death and paſſion of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is not ſufficient for the ſaluation of the whole world? Truely it is not to be douted, for although it be nether auailable nor appliable to any other, than to ſuch as beleue in him: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his ſacrifice is more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſufficient to ſaue all the world. And furthermore wheras the Catholickes (at the leaſt wiſe the ſimple common people) imagine that the Proteſtants in reiecting the maſſe, doe reiect the holy Sacrament of the body &amp; bloud of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> they deceyue themſelues greatly: for contrariwiſe, the Proteſtantes hold the ſame ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his true perfection, as we haue ſhowed in the Chapter going
<pb facs="tcp:3170:77"/> before.</p>
               <p>Neither do they reiect the textes that are ſtuffed into the Maſſe, and be taken out of the holy Scripture: But they like much better to read &amp; learn them in the bible it ſelfe, than in the Maſſebooke. Neither do they reiect the good prayers which are mingled in the Maſſe: but they ſay it is much better to pray to God with a contynu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>al prayer, for Princes &amp; Magiſtrates, for the Shepheards of the church, for the neceſſities of all the people, for the remiſſion of ſinnes, for thoſe which are ſick and afflicted, for the conſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the faithfull, for the inlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ignorant, and for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of the kingdome of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> as they themſelues doe: than to ſay an <hi>Oremus</hi> or particular prayer for euery of theſe thinges as the Prieſt doth in his maſſe, which ſayth now one <hi>Oremus</hi> for himſelfe, and by and by another for the Pope, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a third for his benefactors, and for thoſe that are departed, and often times for brute beaſtes, as is done in the Maſſe of S. <hi>Anthony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For beſides that the moſt part of the prayers in the maſſe be not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3170:77"/> by the word of God: It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that men pray more hartely, more aduiſedly, and with greater zeal when the prayer is contynued to the end without interruption, than when it is ſayd by iumps with often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, the people which do harken to the Prieſtes <hi>Oremus,</hi> cannot ſet their mindes well vpon the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which he is ſaying, becauſe they vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtand it not, nor often times the Prieſt himſelfe.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort therfore, by this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Proteſtants, God is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honored, than by the doctrine of the Catholicks. For the Proteſtants in not admitting any other ſacrifice than that which our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> himſelfe did make of his own body vpon the croſſe, which ſacrifice they eſteeme to be very ſufficient and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect for our ſaluation, doe therby yeald the honor and the effect of our felicity, vnto our Lorde <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> onelye: wheras the Catholiques doe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute parte of his honor to the Prieſt, and parte to the ſacrifice of the Mas.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the Proteſtantes doe much better honor God, in learning
<pb facs="tcp:3170:78"/> the texts of Scripture in the Bible it ſelfe, which is the very originall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of his will: than thoſe which wil needes learn them in the Maſſebook, where they be confuſedly packed and vnaptly applyed.<note place="margin">The only ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt is our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> And now to ſhew that the doctrine of the Proteſtantes (which admitte the only Sacrifice of Chriſt, and reiect the Sacrifice of the Maſſe) is euidently grounded vpon the holy Scripture, there needeth no other witnes than the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> For, firſt he doth teſtifie vnto vs, that there is none other Sacrifice for the remiſſion of mennes ſinnes, but <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> only, and that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by his own bloud, hath obtayned for vs an euerlaſting redemtion: For thus he ſayth: <hi>Chriſt being become the high Prieſt of the good things that are to come,</hi>

That is to ſay, not of this building, nor by the bloud of Goates and Calues, but by his own bloud, is entered in once into the holy place, and hath found eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demtion.</hi> And to the end we ſhould not thinke that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is no more a Prieſt, but that although he was once a Prieſt, yet as now he hath reſigned
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3170:78"/> that office vnto others: The Apoſtle teſtifyeth that he is a Prieſt ſtill, and euer ſhall be, ſaying thus of him:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4.5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art a high Prieſt for euer, after the order of <hi>Melchizedech.</hi>
                  </hi> And becauſe we ſhold not thinke that there ſhould be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prieſt tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he: the Apoſtle teacheth vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there may be none other, in that he ſaith that no man may take the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of high prieſt vnto himſelfe, except he be called of God, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to that office by his Father. Theſe be his very words: <hi>No man may take that honor vpon him, but he ſhall enioy it, which is called of God, as was Aaron. Neyther hath Chriſt preſumed of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be made high Preeſt, but he hath beſtowed that dignity vpon him, which fayde vnto him: Thou art my ſonne, this day haue I begotten thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as we are taught by this text, that neyther there is, nor ought to be any mo then one Sacrifice for the forgeuenes of ſins, that is to wit, <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> which is and ſhalbe the high preeſt for euer: So are we taught alſo by other texts, that there is but one only Sacrifice once offered for all ſinnes, and to obtayn euerlaſting life, which is, the death and paſſion of <hi>Ieſus
<pb facs="tcp:3170:79"/> Chriſt</hi> our Saviour. And that we need none other Sacrifice for the remiſſion of our ſinnes but only that. This is the very text of the Apoſtle, which is ſo playn and cleere as nothing can be more. <hi>By the which will we are made holy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.10 14.18.</note> 
                  <hi>euen by the offering of the body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> once for all. For by that one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering hath he made them perfect for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, which are to be ſanctified: &amp; where remiſsion of ſinnes is, there needes no more Sacrifice for ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which words of the Apoſtle are a very definitiue ſentence pronounced againſt the Maſſe. For if there be no more offering for ſinne, what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the maſſe, ſeeing it is no other thing in ſubſtance (as the very words of the conſecration doe declare) but a Sacrifice and an offering for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenes of the ſinnes of the quick and the dead? And in very deede the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Schooleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not being able by any meanes to rid themſelues of theſe textes which are ſo playne and cleere, do ſay for their refuge, that the Mas is not a very Sacrifice in deed, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the only and true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the anſwere to this ſhift of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3170:79"/> deſcant is very eaſie. For ſeeing they doe maintayne that the very body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in the mas, and that the bread of the ſingingcake is changed into his very body, and the wine into his very bloud: And that they breake his body in peeces, and offer vp both the body and the bloud in Sacrifice vnto God: It followeth of neceſſitie, that their opinion is, that it is a very Sacrifice and not a remembrance only.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the proteſtants doe ſay that the remembrance of the true Sacrifice of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> ought to be done by celebrating his holy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per after the ſame maner that he hath appointed it. For he hath ordayned that his Supper ſhould be celebrated by many at once, becauſe it is a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall communion of the body and bloud of our Sauiour, by the which we are made one body, and as it were one loafe in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp; become par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of one ſelfeſame bread of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the wordes of S. <hi>Paule</hi> vpon the ſame matter:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1. Cor.</hi> 10.16.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Is not the cup of bleſsing which we bleſſe, a partaking of the bloud of Chriſt? And is not the bread which we breake a partaking of
<pb facs="tcp:3170:80"/> the body of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> For we that are many are one loafe and one body, becauſe we be al partakers of one bread.</hi> By which text it appeareth euidently that the remembrance of the Sacrifice of our Sauiour ought to be vſed in celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the holy Supper by many toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, accordingly as when he did inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and celebrate it with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, they were many together. And ſo conſequently it followeth, that the Mas neither is, nor can be a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the ſacrifice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing that none taketh part of it but the prieſt him ſelfe. Now let vs come to the Canones.</p>
               <p>The Canons which we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged in the former Chapter, when we ſpake of the Lordes Supper, doe ſufficiently confute this Tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiation.</note> But I will ſpeake of certain difficulties, into the which the Tranſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath led the ſchole diuines, as it hapneth commonly (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaying of the Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) that in admitting one abſurditie, there follow many moe. The ſchole
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3170:80"/> doctors hauing once graunted that the bread and wine in the Maſſe, are Tranſubſtantiated into the very body and bloud of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> are greately troubled how to reſolue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other queſtions,<note place="margin">C. Cum Marthae queſiuiſti. extr. de ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebr. Miſſ.</note> which haue growen vpon the ſame matter. Pope Innocent the third reciteth one of them, which he ſayth was greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated amongſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſayd Scholedoctors, (howbeit in ſuch ſort, as they knew not how to determine it) That is to witt, whether the water which the preeſt putteth into the chalice with the wine, be tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiated into bloud or not, for they imagine, that water muſt nedes be put into the chalice where the wine is, bicauſe it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that out of the ſide of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, there did iſſue both bloud and water.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, their opinion is, that there ought to be more wine than water.<note place="margin">C. Pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſus. extr. eo</note> For Pope Honorius the third, did ſharply checke a certayne Biſhop, who in ſinging maſſe did put more water in his chalice then wine: wherupon grew a great diſputation amongſt the Scholediuines, as Pope Innocent, reporteth. For ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3170:81"/> held opinion, that the water was not Tranſubſtantiated into wine, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned naturall water ſtill, bicauſe (ſay they) there was water in the bloud which iſſued out of the ſide of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, when he was vpon the Croſſe. And therfore, ſeeing that the wine in the Chalice at the maſſe tyme, is Tranſubſtantiated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very bloud: it muſt needes be, that the water remayneth water ſtill, to the ende that there be an anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reſemblance, aſwell of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as of the bloud. Others ſayd, that although it were graunted that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, muſt needes remayne ſtill in the Chalice with the bloud, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it muſt alwayes be beleeued, that the water which the prieſt put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth into the Challice, is turned into the ſelfe ſame water which iſſued out of the ſide of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Which opinion ſeemeth to haue moſt ſhew of wit, and moſt proportionble reſemblance agreeing to the matter, though at the firſt ſight it might ſeeme an abſurde thinge, to ſaye that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is turned into other water. For looke by what reaſon the wine is tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated into the very bloud, by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3170:81"/> the ſame reaſon is the water changed into the water.</p>
               <p>The third opinion is taken out of <hi>Galene,</hi> and other Phiſitions, which ſay that mannes body is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of fower humors. That is, of bloud, of flewme, of melancholy, and of choller: and therfore (ſay they that are of that opinion) it is very like, that when the Euangeliſt ſayd, that with the bloud there iſſued water out of the ſide of <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> he meant that there iſſued out fleame, which is a wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>try humor: Wherupon they doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that in the Maſſe water was changed into fleame.<note place="margin">C. in quada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> extr. de ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb.

               </p>
               <p>The fourth opinion is of ſuch as vphold that the water alſo is changed into bloud, as well as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine. Which opinion the ſaid Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to haue in it, not moſt truth, but moſt likelyhode of trueth: Becauſe (ſaith he) water is often times in the Scripture taken for the multitude of the people: ſo as the vnion which is made betwixt the water and the wine by the tranſubſtantiating of the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:3170:82"/> water into wine, doth ſignifie vnto vs the true knitting together of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with his people, by ſuch a bonde as cannot be broken. Truely, a reaſon drawen out of a quintiſens of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties of <hi>Scotus,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Duns.</hi> Marke here the goodly queſtions, or rather the fonde and heatheniſh dota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, wherin the Schoolemen and the Popes haue wrapped themſelues, by the meane of their Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe alſo they finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues greatly cumbred in anſwering theſe other queſtions: that is to wit, if a mouſe or a rat doe happen to eate the Sacrament of the hoaſt, whether ſhe eat the very body or the accidents only. Again, whether the Accidentes can be without a ſubiect, and whether Accidentes can be eaten or no. Alſo, whether the Accident without the ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iect may haue the taſt of the wine, and geue nouriſhment to the body: and ſuch other vaine queſtions, whereof they can geue none but very abſurde reſolutions, becauſe the preſuppoſing of tranſubſtantiation, is nothing but abſurditie.</p>
               <p>Beſides this the Canons ſay not

               <p>Were this Canon wel vnderſtood of the infinite number of pore igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſoules that hold of the Romiſh Religion, and doe ordinarily hear the Maſſes and other Church ſeruices of lecherous prieſtes: I beleeue, they would rather forbeare it vtterly, than defile themſelues ſo wretchedly with Idolatrie. And (as ſaith this Canon) receiue the curſe of God in receiuing the bleſſing of ſuch a prieſt. But igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance accompanied with error, which hath been long bred and rooted in the Romain Church, doe cauſe the poore people to be content to heare the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of theſe Fornicators.

               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:3170:85"/>

                  <hi>If any man make difference of a marryed Prieſt, in forbearing to come to his offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as though he might not doe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is marryed: Curſed be he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there is yet another Canon which ſaith that no Prieſt hath power to conſecrate ſingingcakes, except he be a man of good life. Which thing ſhould make the Romiſh Catholicks to thinke that they put them ſelues in great danger of Idolatry, when they worſhip the ſinging cake, although it were admitted that their doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation were true, which thing the Proteſtants doe ſtill deny. For queſtionles, by this Canon all be Idolaters which worſhip the ſinging bread that is conſecrated by prieſts of euill life, as the moſt part of them be.

                  <hi>The prieſtes which miniſter the body and bloud of the Lord vnto the people, doe wickedly, in beleeuing that by the law of Chriſt, it is the wordes which the prieſt ſpeaketh, and not his good life which make the conſecration of the Sacrament: And that to doe the ſame, there nedeth but only the ſolemne pronouncing of the prayer, without any

               </p>
               <p>So then by this Canon it may be well ſaid, that in theſe dayes there are very few Prieſtes which haue power to conſecrate.</p>

                  <hi>Of Maryage.</hi> The ix. Chapter.</head>
               <p>AS co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cering marriage, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of the Proteſtauntes differeth not much from the doctrine of the romiſh catholickes. In deed the Catholickes do terme it a ſacrament, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes ſay it is a holy inſtitution of God, but not a ſacrament: becauſe that in euery ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, there muſt be an outward ſigne to bee diſcerned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the eie, and an inward thing ſignified, which is inuiſible, as I haue ſayed of Baptiſme heretofore, ſhewing that in that ſacrament, the water is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigne, and the waſhing of the ſoule is the inward &amp; inuiſible thing ſignified: And in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſupper of our lord, the bread and the wine are the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes, and the body and the bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt bee the things ſignified, which our ſoules do receiue inwardly and ſpiritually.</p>
               <p>But it cannot be ſayd, that in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ther is an outward viſible ſigne and an inward &amp; inuiſible thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified: And therfore it is not a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Agayne the Proteſtants affirm that marriage is honorable amongſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3170:87"/> all ſorts of people, be they lay men or men of the church, noble or vnnoble, rich or poore, becauſe God hath inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted it. and hath permitted the vſe thereof to all perſons of what quality ſoeuer they be, and to celebrate the ſame at all ſeaſons: And that to make gloſes and limitations or reſtrayntes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which God hath ſet at liberty, is to goe about to be wiſer than God, which in deede is ſtarke fooliſhneſſe, beaſtly preſumption, and heddy tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſneſſe.<note place="margin">The Papiſts make forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</note> Contrarywiſe the romiſh Catholickes holde opinion, that it is not lawfull for men of the church to be married at all, nor to celebrate any marriage in Lent, in Aduent, and in the foure ember weeks. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereupon they haue founded this doctrine, is that they haue imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it to be a ſtayning and defiling of the Churchmen, (which doe handle ſacred thinges) to be married: In ſo much as there hath bene ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which haue termed ſecond marriages by the name of honeſt fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">C. Hac ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione. 11. q. 3 C. Non o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portet. &amp; ſeq. 33. q. 4</note> And yet for all their forbidding of Prieſtes to be married, they haue allowed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to keep concubines, as we haue ſayd before, in the fourth chap. By meanes
<pb facs="tcp:3170:88"/> whereof they haue geuen them leaue to tranſgreſſe Gods commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which ſaith, <hi>thou ſhalt not commit adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> by taking from them the liberty of Marriage, which god doth allowe to all perſons. But if it ſhould be aſked them, wherfore prieſtes (whom they eſteme holy and ſacred perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) ſhould not vſe marriage, which they call a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: what would they anſwere? For ſacramentes are meeteſt thinges for ſacred perſons. And if marriage be a ſacrament, (as they holde opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is:) can it defile thoſe which partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the ſame? Truely it is as abſurd a thing to ſay that a Sacrament can defile, as to ſay that whiteneſſe can make blacke. Thus doth it followe that God is better honored, and his ordinances are more ſincerely obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the doctrine of the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, than by che doctrine of the catholicks. The doctrine of the Proteſtantes is clerly founded vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcripture, whereby Marriage is commaunded to all ſuch as haue not the gift of ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes, as before is ſayd in the fourth chapter. For when God ordayned mariage firſt of all at the creation of world, he gaue this generall rule: <hi>It
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3170:88"/> is not good for man to be alone.</hi>

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is eaſy to iudge, whether of the parties are beſt grounded vpon the word of God, namely whether it bee the Proteſtantes, (who hold opinion that the celebration of Marriage is lawfull to al people, and at al ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s:) or the Romiſh Catholickes, which mayntayne that it is not lawfull for Prieſtes, Monkes, and Nunnes: nor ought to be celebrated in the lent, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, or the foure ember weekes.</p>
               <p>There be Canons alſo,<note place="margin">That the Mariage of Prieſts is lawfull.</note> which doe flatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne the doctrine of the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Catholickes in this poynte, and which affirme that marriage ought not to be forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to men of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, which thing was alſo maintayned by a good Byſhoppe named <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> (although himſelfe was neuer marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) in the firſt generall counſell holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3170:89"/> at Nice in the countrey of Bithinia, In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> raigne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor <hi>Constantine</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great: which opinion of his was fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lowed by conſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> counſel.

                  <hi>The counſel of Nice intending to correct the liues of the Eccleſiaſticall perſons, made certayn lawes called Canons: in conſulting wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>upon, it ſeemed to incline to the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of a law, to forbid Biſhops, Prieſts, Deacons, and Subdeacons to lye with theyr wiues which they had taken in marriage before their entring into holy orders. Then <hi>Paphnutius</hi> ſtanding vppe, ſpake agaynſt it, ſaying that marryage is an honorable thing, and that it is chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for a man to vſe the company of his owne wife. And ſo he perſwaded the Counſell, not to make any ſuch law: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging this reaſon both right graue and of great importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, namely that it might be an occaſion of fornication to the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall perſons the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or to their wiues. Such matter did <hi>Paphnutius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge, notwithſtanding that he himſelfe was neuer married: and his aduice was allowed by all the counſell, in ſo much that there was no law made then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that article, but the matter was left at liberty for euery man to do as he
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3170:89"/> liſted.</hi> Loe here a very notable and au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t canon, which hath euerſince bene obſerued and kept in the eaſtern chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which would neuer ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be bound to the vow of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life. And if the weſterne churche of Rome had done the like: Prieſts had neuer filled the world with ſo muche whoredome and wickedneſſe as they haue done. And vnto this Canon of the counſell of Nice, is agreeable the fifteth chap. of the Apoſtolick cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, (which are allowed, for good &amp; Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lick in the Decrees of <hi>Graecian</hi>) where it is ſayd thus: <hi>If any Byſhop, prieſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. Quonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſt. 31. C. Placuit. diſt. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acon or Subdeacon, or any other man of the order of Prieſthood, doe abſtayne from marriage, or from eating fleſh, or from drinking of wine, not to make his mind more apt to the exerciſes of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, but as in way of miſliking them, forgetting that God hath made bothe male and female, and that all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be good thinges, and ſo thereby blaming and ſlaundering that, which god hath created, let him be corrected, or depoſed and put out of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which Canon is condemned not onely the prohibition of mariage vnto prieſtes, but alſo the forbidding
<pb facs="tcp:3170:90"/> of men to eat fleſh vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certayn daies, whereunto doth well accord, that which S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> did write to one <hi>Dracontius</hi> a Moonke, who refuſed to be a biſhop, becauſe he imagined that the Monkes life had more holines in it, by reaſon that the Moonkes dyd obſerue more ſcrupulouſly the prohy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of marriage, and the eating of certayne meates.<note place="margin">Athanaſius in his epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contius.</note> 
                  <hi>Well then</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>let not ſuch things be alleadged to thee by ſuch as counſell thee to ſhunne the charge of a Byſhop. For I haue knowne Byſhops which haue bene great faſters, And Monkes which haue bene great ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters! And Biſhops which haue dronk no wine, &amp; Monks great drinkers of wine: Byſhops which haue bene workers of miracles, &amp; Monks which haue wrought none. Agayne diuerſe Byſhops haue ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from marriage, and many monks haue bene maried and had children: And contrariwiſe, there haue bene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Byſhops maried and bene fathers of children: and many Monkes vnmaried. And there haue bene clergie men that haue eaten and drunke, and Moonkes which haue faſted: For both of them be lawfull, and none of them both is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biden, but euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may lawfully choſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3170:90"/> which he liſteth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereby this good doctor doth playnly declare, that in his time mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was not forbidden to menne of the clergye, nor to any monks. And in like manner the auntient Canons accurſe al thoſe, which in exalting vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity do condemne marriage. Theſe be the wordes of the Canon:<note place="margin">C. quicu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>que diſt. <hi>31.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer keepeth virginity or ſingle life, as in derogation of marriage, curſed bee hee, becauſe his folowing of virginity, is not for that it is good and holy.</hi> And in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deed, the true virginity is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which conſiſteth in the mind rather than in the body, as witneſſeth an other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, ſaying: <hi>It is much better to haue the ſoule a virgin, than the fleſh:</hi>

                  <hi>yet wer it good to haue them both ſo, if it may be. But if wee cannot bee chaſte to the worldward, let vs yet at the leſt be chaſt towardes God. For a true virgine maye wel be miſuſed, but ſhe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be made a whore, becauſe the godly virgine is the church of God, and her chaſtity cannot be defiled by the brothelhouſe. For the chaſtity of the minde aboliſheth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy of the place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the vnderſtanding of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which Canon, we muſt haue an eye to the
<pb facs="tcp:3170:91"/> time of the primitiue Church, when diuers among the heathen men did put their bondſlaues (whether they were wiues or maydens) into brothel houſes and common ſtewes, to rayſe gayne of the ſhamefull abuſe of their bodies. And it fel out oftentimes that their poore ſlaues were Chriſtians, and yet full ill againſt their willes, they were faine to ſuffer that ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full abuſe in their bodies, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as it were open brothels and harlots, to make gaine to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. wherof they are excuſed by this Canon, as hauing only their bodies abuſed by a forcible conſtrainte, and not their mindes by conſent of their willes. Now therfore it may wel be diſcerned by theſe Canones, whether this doctrine of the Proteſtants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning mariage, ought to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted erroneous or not, and whether it be not more agreable to Gods word, and the auncient Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, than the doctrine of the Romiſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes. And now let vs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on.</p>

And they beleeue that to diſobay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince, is a diſobaying of God who hath ſet him vp. And that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt obay him, not only for feare, but alſo for the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conſcience, which doth binde vs

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The Pope chalengeth power to put downe Princes.</note> they hold opinion that the Pope hath power to put down kings and Princes, and to depriue them of their Realmes and Principalities, as Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> vaunteth himſelfe in an epiſtle ſent to the Emperor <hi>Anaſtaſius:</hi> wherin he alleadgeth the example of Pope <hi>Zachary,</hi> who depoſed king <hi>Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derike</hi> of Fraunce from his kingdome,<note place="margin">C. alius. <hi>15.</hi> q. <hi>6.</hi>

               <p>Euery man therefore may iudge whether doctrine is the better, either that of the romiſh Catholicks, (which doth ſo limmit &amp; cut ſhort the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of kinges and Princes, to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the greatnes of the Popes and Prelats.) Or that of the Proteſtants,
<pb facs="tcp:3170:93"/> which doe not challenge, but diſalow ſuch limitations, affirming that the Pope hath no ſuch iuriſdiction ouer the Subiects of kings and Princes. And ſeeing that Princes be the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenantes of God here on earth, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Scepters and Crowne of him: No doute but the honor which is done to them, is done to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And ſo conſequently, God is better honored by the doctrine of the Proteſtantes, than by the doctrine of the Romiſh Catholicks.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of the Proteſtantes is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded euidently vpon the word of God, which commaundeth all men (without exception of any perſon) to obay the Prince vnder whoſe Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they dwell, not only for feare of his ſword, but alſo for conſcience ſake.

               </p>
               <p>And hereupon S. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſaith that this rule is ſo generall, that there is neither Apoſtle, nor Euangeliſt,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3170:93"/> nor Biſhop, nor other perſon, that is exempted from the obedience of the Prince. And likewiſe S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to al Chriſtians, and to al Gods choſen flock, ſayth thus:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15</note>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3170:102"/> an other place S.

               <p>Let vs now come to the Canons.

Now then you muſt firſt of all vnderſtand, that the auncient doctors of the church do ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſe this name of pope, which ſignifyeth, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t time, was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently vſed to all Biſhoppes aſwell
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3170:103"/> meane as great. But in the end, the Boſhop of Rome appropriated the ſame to himſelfe alone, and from that tyme forth, this name of pope hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bene taken, (as it is ſtill in theſe dayes) not for a father but for a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme head and vniuerſall Biſhop of all the Chriſtian churches of the world: which title of vniuerſall is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by all the auncient Canons, &amp; ſo conſequently the eſtate which the pope of Rome doth take vpon him at this preſent, is condemned: For it is well knowne that he nameth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the vniuerſall Shepheard or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and that he chalengeth authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ouer all churches and councels. Now harken to the very words of a Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which putteth him to his neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. <hi>Let no Patriarke at any tyme vſe the name of vniuerſall.</hi>

But Godforbid that any of the faythfull ſhould chalendge honor to himſelfe, to the derogation of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, be it neuer ſo little. Wherefore we beſech you of your charity, let none of you from henceforth in his letters, geue the title of vniuerſall, to any man
<pb facs="tcp:3170:104"/> any more leaſt ye take away the title due vnto your ſelues by attributing the ſame vnduely vnto orhers.</hi> The next Canon following doth ſing the ſame ſong, which ought to be of ſo much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more force among the Romiſh Catholicks for that it is taken out of an Epiſtle of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the patriark of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria:</hi> Thus therefore doth he ſay in expreſſe wordes. <hi>Behold euen in the very preface of your letters which you wrote vnto me, you go about to caſt the proud name of vniuerſal pope vpon me, euen vpon me (I ſay) who haue forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other men to vſe it. Wherefore I beſech your holines, euen of your curteſy, to do ſo no more, for you take from your ſelfe to geue to an other, without cauſe why. I ſeek not to aduaunce my ſelfe in tytles but in manners: neither thinke I that I ought to purchaſe honour to my ſelfe, with the loſſe of the honour of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for my honor is to honor the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall church, and to behaue my ſelfe vprightly towardes my brethren. And I thinke my ſelfe then moſt honored, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery of them hath his due honour yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto him. But if your holines name me the vniuerſall pope: then in attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the whole vnto me, ther is nothing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3170:104"/> left to others: which God forbid where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs driue away theſe termes farre from vs, which inflame vs with vanity, and hurt charity.</hi> The reaſon of theſe Canons is very euident: namely, for that it is impoſſible for one man to go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerne the vniuerſall church, and to be Byſhop of the whole world, ſeeing that euen they which are beſt able, do finde themſelues greatly combred in the gouerning of one onely Byſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick well. Beſides this the title of vni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſal Biſhop, is to ſtately and proud to be matched with the true Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes of gods church, which ought to walke in humility, voyd of al pride and ambition. The ſame thing is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by a cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in theſe expres words <hi>Whoſoeuer deſireth ſupremacy vpon earth, ſhall finde confuſion in heauen.</hi>

For hee is not the moſt righteous, which amongſt men is moſt honored: but he is moſt honorable, which is moſt righteous</hi> Hereunto agreeth well the Canon which ſayth that all churches are equall in authoritye, and that the
<pb facs="tcp:3170:105"/> chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ch of Rome hath no ſuperiority ouer other churches, This Canon is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of S.

               </p>
               <p>Now then it appeareth plainly by theſe Canons, that the pope (who in all his bulles doth name himſelfe the Biſhop of Rome) is no greater than another meane Biſhop, &amp; that neither he, nor the Church of Rome, can claime to themſelues any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer other Biſhops and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, otherwiſe than by tiranny and

                  </note> who ſo will reade his epiſtle, ſhal find that he vtterly deteſted this title of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall Shepheard or Biſhop from his hart, as a wicked title not meete for any but for Antichriſt or for his forerunner. In one of his Epiſtles he complaineth greatly to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Maurice,</hi> that <hi>Iohn</hi> Biſhop of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople did trouble the Church of God, by ſeeking to vſurpe the title of vniuerſall Biſhop. For (to the intent ye may vnderſtand the very roote and originall beginning of this diſcourſe) you muſt conſider that in thoſe daies, and long time before, Conſtantinople was called new Rome, and the other in Italy was called olde Rome. And becauſe the Emperor of Rome did moſt commonly keep his reſidence at new Rome, and olde Rome was at that time greatly vexed with the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Gothes, &amp; Lumbards which warred vpon Italy and deſtroyed it: without doubt the new Rome was then a more flouriſhing Citie, and in higher eſtimation than olde Rome, or any other Citie in all the wholl Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
<pb facs="tcp:3170:106"/> Wherupon the ſaid Biſhop <hi>Iohn</hi> being of an ambitious diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and minding to aduance himſelfe by the dignitie of the Citie whereof he was biſhop, began to preach and perſuade the people and diuers of the biſhops, that like as the Emperor extended his dominion ouer all the prouinces and countreys of the Empire: euen ſo the Biſhoppe of Rome (that is to ſay of new Rome) which was then in more eſtimation than old Rome, ought to extend his power and autooritie ouer all the prouinces and countreys of Chriſtendome.</p>
               <p>And truly this Biſhop <hi>Iohn</hi> did ſo much by his continuall trauell, that he cauſed him ſelfe to be proclaymed vniuerſal Biſhop in a certain Sinode or Counſell, wheragainſt S. <hi>Gregory</hi> (who was then biſhop of old Rome) did ſet himſelfe very manfullye. And therefore writing againe to the ſame Emperor <hi>Maurice,</hi> he ſaith amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges there written, that the name of vniuerſal Biſhop is a title of pride and pompe, which troubleth the church, the lawes, and the ſinodes, and the commaundements of Chriſt: And that S. <hi>Peter</hi> neuer was, ne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3170:106"/> called himſelfe vniuerſall Apoſtle. And that it was the Emperors duty, (if he meant that God ſhould long preſerue his empire) to cut of that ſore and to bridle the diſeaſe by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, if it could not otherwiſe be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Afterward he addeth theſe words worthy to be noted. <hi>If any man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doe attribute vnto himſelfe the name of vniuerſall Biſhop in the church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. Gregory whom the Catholicks take for an Archpope, condemneth the authori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty of Popes.</note> 
                  <hi>what will al honeſt men iudge of him? For the eſtat of the vniuerſall Church muſt nedes fall (which God forbid) if he fall which is called the vniuerſall Biſhop. Therfore let this blaſphemous name be baniſhed from the harts of all Chriſtians, whereby the honor of all Prieſtes is taken away, and wrongfully vſurped by one alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the Epiſtle following, S. <hi>Gregory</hi> maketh his mone to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe <hi>Conſtance,</hi> that the ſaid Emperor <hi>Maurice</hi> her huſband went about to perſwade him to leaue of his ſetting of himſelfe againſt it, which I cannot doe (ſaith he) for I defend the cauſe of the Goſpell, and the Canons, and the truth of equitie and humilitie. And it is to greeuous &amp; intollerable a thing that the ſayd <hi>Iohn</hi> our fellow brother and biſhop, ſhould ſeeke to haue the
<pb facs="tcp:3170:107"/> name of biſhop to himſelf alone. But what other thing doth he geue vs to vnderſtand by this his pride, but that the time of Antichriſt draweth neare? For he followeth the ſteps of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked feend, who deſpiſing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ioy which he had in common amongſt the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other Aungels, dyd ſeeke to ſet himſelfe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hygheſt roome, to raigne as ſoueraigne all alone,</p>
               <p>And in an other Epiſtle, the ſame S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> anſwering to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche the ſayd Emperour <hi>Maurice</hi> had written vnto him, which was that hee ought not to bee ſo preciſely wedded to his own will for the terme of vniuerſall Biſhop, for ſuch ſtrife about termes hinder the vnion and peace of the church: did diſproue his reaſons with very good grace,<note place="margin">Ep. lib. <hi>6.</hi> ep. <hi>194.</hi>
                  </note> ſaying thus: <hi>But I beſeech your maieſtie of your goodnes, to conſider that of words fondly ſpoken ſome doe no harme at all, &amp; other ſome doe great harme. As for example, when Antichriſt ſhall come and call himſelfe God, that ſpeech is very fond: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les as it is fonde, ſo is it alſo very perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. If you looke no further tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the wordes, there are but two ſillables: but if you way the meaning of the wordes,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3170:107"/> it is the full importance of all iniquitie. And I dare boldlye ſay vnto you, that whoſoeuer calleth himſelfe, or cauſeth himſelfe to be called the vniuerſal prieſt, the ſame partie through his vainglory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, is the foreronner of Antichriſt, becauſe that by his pride, he exalteth himſelfe aboue all others. I beſech you therefore of your good zeale to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to commaund that no cauſe of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence be geuen by taking vp ſuch a fond title.</hi> See how S. <hi>Gregorye</hi> declareth and denowceth him to be the foreron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Antichriſt, which doth name himſelfe vniuerſall Byſhop, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he taketh vpon him the auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye of all other Byſhops, as wel neere all the Popes of Rome haue done, which haue bene ſince his time. And yet to confirme this his ſentence better, I wil adde the warning which he gaue by his letters to the Byſhops of Greece, to be well ware that they gaue not the title of vniuerſall By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, to <hi>Siriacke</hi> Byſhop of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople next ſucceſſor of the ſaid <hi>Iohn</hi> after his deceaſe:<note place="margin">Epist. lib. <hi>7.</hi> epiſt. <hi>69.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:3170:108"/> of the meaſure of his calling, did wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in a Synode vſurpe the proud and peſtilent title of Oycumenicall (that is to ſay vniuerſall) Byſhop agaynſt God and the Church, and to the deſpight &amp; derogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the whole order of Preeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode. Wherupon wee wrote twiſe vnto him, that he ſhould not omit any thing, which might concerne the peace of the Church, exhorting him to leaue that proud name, and to ſubmit his hart to the humilitye, which our Lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath taught vs. Whereof foraſmuch as he held ſcorne, we haue vſed the lyke admonitions vnto our brother <hi>Siriacke,</hi> his ſucceſſor. But ſith wee ſee that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt the enemy of mankinde, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to ſhew himſelfe ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly by his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronners in this latter tyme: and that the preeſtes themſelues, (which ought to reſiſt him by their holy &amp; humblelyfe,) be the partyes that ſerue him for his foreronners, by intitling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with his proud name of vniuerſall: I beſeech yee, yea and charge ye, that none of you at any tyme, receyue, admit, write, allow written, or ſubſcribe vnto that title: But that as becommeth the ſeruauntes of the almighty God,) euery of you keepe himſelfe pure and cleare from this vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3170:108"/> infection, without yelding of him ſelfe, to the deceitfull craftines of the enemy: for ſurely that title tendeth to no other end, but to the hurt, and diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, and to the ſlaunder of you all, as I haue ſayd before: becauſe that if he onely (as he imagineth) is the vniuerſall Byſhop, it followeth that you be no Byſhops.</hi> There are yet diuers other like ſayings, in the writings of S. Gregory, which I could here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge, but theſe which I haue here be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore ſet downe, may ſuffice (in mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) to declare and ſhew vnto the Romiſh Catholicks by the authority of that god doctor (whom they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues take to haue beene one of the greateſt &amp; worthieſt of all the Popes, in reſpect whereof they haue ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him the great S. Gregory) that the name and office of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope (which is nothing elſe but an vniuerſall and ſupreme Byſhop or ſhepheard ouer all other Byſhops and Prieſtes,) is condemned as the name and office of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> or of his forerunner, and as a title and eſtate full of pride, iniury, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, and contempt of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and of the holy decrees and counſels which haue bene holde
<pb facs="tcp:3170:109"/> before that tyme.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">That S. paul and S. Peter were equall in degree.</note>But now that we haue made S.

                  <hi>S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paule</hi> haue preheminence aboue all other Apoſtles, by ſpeciall prerogatiue. But yet is it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certayne whether of them two were pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferred before the other. For I think that they were both equall in deſerts, &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in their deathes and paſsions: and alſo that they liued in like deuotion of faith and finally, came Both together to the glory of martirdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I beleue that it hapned not with
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3170:109"/> out ſome cauſe, that they both ſuffered martirdome in one day, in one place, and vnder one perſecuter, for they ſuffered in one day, that they might goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in company to Chriſt: and in one place, to the end that Rome ſhould not want either of them both, &amp; vnder one perſecuter, that both of them might be partakers of one cruelty. The day there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was ordayned for their deſert, the place for their glory, and the perſecuter for their vertue. And they both ſuffered martirdome at Rome the ſoueraign La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and head of all nations, to the end that where the head of ſuperſtition was, there ſhould reſt the head of holines: &amp; where the princes of the Gentils dwelt, there ſhould remayn the Princes of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which Canon it may eaſely be iudged,<note place="margin">S. Peter was neuer head of the Church.</note> that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was in nothing to be preferred before S. <hi>Paule,</hi> &amp; that both were equal in all reſpects, which ſheweth plainly that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer head of the Church, neither in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of nature, nor in reſpect of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. For if he had been, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould as much haue been ſayd of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Canon. And ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, we ſhould ſay that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church
<pb facs="tcp:3170:110"/> had then two heads like a monſter, a thing that were to abſurde &amp; ſtrange. I know wel that ſuch as imagine the gouernment of the Church to be like the gouernment of a kingdome,<note place="margin">The Lordly gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the auncient Canons.</note> doe thinke it meete that there ſhould be one ſupreme head and gouerner, and that the ſame ſhould haue Cardinals as great Princes of his court, &amp; Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops ſomewhat in lower degree than the Cardinals, and Biſhops as inferiors to the Archbiſhops, and ſo conſequently Abbots, Priors, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and Curats, ech in degree vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der other. And in good ſooth, this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of holy gouernment hath a fayre outward ſhew, but there is one thing that marreth all, which is, that it hath no foundation in the word of God, which doth not teach that there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inequalitie amongeſt the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, but that they ought to gouern their Churches with one common conſent by Gods word, making aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies or meetings, (which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Sinodes or Councels) for the ſame purpoſe, if need require. And moreouer that they ought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mit themſelues to the Ciuill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. And the very Canons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3170:110"/> doe agree herewith, (ſpecially one Canon which is taken out of S. <hi>Iherom,</hi>) ſeeing, that in the time of the primitiue Church there was no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a prieſt or an elder, and a biſhop: and that the Church was then gouerned by the common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the elders.</p>
               <p>Let vs heare the very words of the Canon.<note place="margin">c. Olim. diſt. <hi>95.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>In olde time an Elder and a Biſhop were all one thing, till ſciſmes and parttakings crept into Religion by the deuils inſpiration, and that folke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſay, I hold of <hi>Paule,</hi> and I of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> and I of <hi>Cephas.</hi> Vntill this time the Churches were gouerned by common aduice of the Elders. But after that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man began to brag of his own diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples whom he had baptiſed, and not of Chriſt, then it was ordayned that in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Church one of the Elders ſhould haue authoritie ouer the reſt, to take away the ſeede of ſcizme. Wherefore like as the Prieſts know that by the cuſtome of the Church, they be put in ſubiection to the party that is ſet in authoritie ouer them: So let the biſhops know alſo that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they themſelues are of more authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie than the Prieſt, it is not by the ordy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, but by cuſtome, and that
<pb facs="tcp:3170:111"/> they ought to gouerne the Church by common aduiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Canon in very truth is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry notable, ſpecially for that it doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently ſhew, that all the degrees and dignities (which are infinite at this day in the Church of Rome) are not grounded vpon the expreſſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, but only vpon the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue law of cuſtome, for looke what the Canon ſpeaketh of Biſhops, is much more by all reaſon to be ſpoken of Cardinals, Patriarches, Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and other dignities, ſeeing that the office of a Biſhop (wherof the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture maketh mention) was inſtituted long time before the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Cardinals and the others. And hereupon it followeth, that men ſhould not make ſo great reckning of any of theſe great and pompous dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, which are founded but onely vpon cuſtome, which ought not to be of any (or at leaſt wiſe of very litle) authoritie in the Church of God, as ſhalbe declared more at large in the laſt chapter of this booke.</p>

I will here a litle examine the truth of the matter. <hi>I ſay therfore that this donation and graunt of prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">c. Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius. diſt. 96</note> 
                  <hi>inregiſtred by <hi>Gratian</hi> in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, is a thing inuented of pleaſure and altogether falſe, and that it neither is like nor poſsible, that the Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And for proofe of this matter, ye muſt firſt vnderſtand, that in their ſayd ſurmiſed donation, they make the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to ſay within foure dayes after he was baptiſed, that he wold haue all the Biſhops and Prieſtes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn Empire, to acknowledge and hold the Biſhop of Rome for their head, in like ſort as the iudges of a Realme doe holde their king: and that he ſhould haue greater authoritie than the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror himſelfe: Geuing vnto <hi>Silueſter</hi> the vniuerſall Pope and to his ſucceſſors, his Imperiall Pallace of Lateran which is at Rome, and the Citie of Rome it ſelfe, with al the Prouinces, Places, and Cities of Italy, and all the weſt part of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, together with the Imperiall Crown of pure golde, inriched with precious ſtones, his Scepter, his mantell of Purple, and his other Imperiall Robes, and the Imperiall dignitie of commaunding the men of warre, with all other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the glory &amp; maieſtie of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.

               </p>
               <p>This in few words is the whole ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of the pretended donation made by the Emperor to the Pope and to the Cleargie of Rome. Wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doctors of the Ciuill Law take mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous paines in diſcuſſing whether it be auaileable or not, and whether <hi>Conſtantine</hi> might ſo greatly diminiſh the Empire, ſeeing that (ſay they) the title of Auguſtus is geuen vnto him, to the intent he ſhould increaſe, and not diminiſh the Empire: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could geue greater authoritie to the Pope, than he himſelfe had, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by the rules of the law, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can graunt to another more right
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3170:113"/> than he hath in himſelfe: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could force or conſtraine his ſucceſſors to obſerue this donation, conſidering that by the Ciuill Law, like againſt like hath no power.</p>
               <p>Theſe doctors (ſay I) haue taken great paynes to reſolue this queſtion and diuers ſuch like vpon that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but all in vaine,<note place="margin">The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of the donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the very dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelfe.</note> for it ought firſt to be prooued that there was ſuch a gifte made, before they diſputed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be lawfull and auaileable or not.

               <p>Therfore to reſolue the ſayd dout by the hiſtory, you muſt vnderſtand, that this donation is reported to haue beene graunted in the time of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> fourth Conſulſhip after his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,<note place="margin">Pomponius laetus. in Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </note> as if they had been both at one time, when as thoſe times were farre aſunder. For his fourth Conſulſhip was in the yeare of our Lord three hundred and eighteene, and his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
<pb facs="tcp:3170:114"/> was more than twenty yeares after: and therfore the diuerſitie of the times doth diſcouer the falſenes of the donation.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, it could not be done in any of both thoſe times, for afore the time of his baptiſme Pope <hi>Silueſter</hi> was already dead, as the hiſtories do well proue, which doe witneſſe, that for the great deſire which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had to be baptiſed in the Riuer of <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,</hi> in Iury, he deferred his Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (by reaſon of the great affayres wherwith he was continually kepte occupied) vntill the latter ende of his life, at which time perceiuing himſelfe to be very ill at eaſe &amp; out of all hope of being able to trauaile into Iury to be baptiſed in the Riuer of <hi>Iordaine,</hi> he cauſed himſelfe to be chriſtened in <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therfore this pretended grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, could not be made by conſtantine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Baptiſme (as the donation it ſelfe doth beare men in hand) to pope Silueſter who was dead before that tyme. Neither could it be done in the tyme of conſtantines fourth conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: For at that tyme (and moe than ten yeres after) he had a fellow in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3170:114"/> Empire named <hi>Licinius</hi> who held the Eaſt part of the Empire, and <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> himſelfe held the weſt partes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome of the Romain Empire then receiued, which was to haue two Emperors at once (as were <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximian,</hi> and alſo <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Maximinus,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius Chorus</hi>) the one commaunding in the Eaſt parts, and the other in the Weſt.<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. eccl. hiſt. 8. cap. <hi>16.</hi> &amp; Pom. lpaetus in vitis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratorum.</note> And therof (as ſome thinke) did grow the cuſtome of paynting the Imperiall <hi>Eagle</hi> with two heads. Now then in aſmuch as <hi>Licinius</hi> remayning at that time in the Eaſt countreys as in his own parte of gouernement, was a Heathen man and a deadly enemy to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> who was a Chriſtian: It followeth in reaſon, that if <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſhould haue geuen vp the Empire of the Weſt to the Pope, he could not haue made his account to haue remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his Imperiall ſeate by and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Eaſt, (for he had reckned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his hoaſt) but it would haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooued him firſt to haue put down <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cinius,</hi> ere he could aſſure himſelfe of the Empire of the Eaſt, as in deed he did afterward by force of armes: But that was more than ten yeares after
<pb facs="tcp:3170:115"/> his fourth Conſulſhippe. But who would thinke <hi>Constantine</hi> to haue been ſuch a foole, as to ſpoyl himſelfe of the Weſt Empire to geue it to the Pope, and to content himſelfe with the Eaſt Empire, which he had not, nor could aſſure himſelfe to haue, conſidering how vncertaine the iſſue of waar is.</p>
               <p>Moreouer about the ſame time of <hi>Constantines</hi> fourth Conſulſhip, there was Ciuill warres in Rome betwixt <hi>Conſtantine</hi> himſelf and <hi>Maxentius,</hi> who had ſet vp himſelfe as an vſurper in the Citie of Rome, through the ayde of the Pretorian Soldiars. By reaſon whereof, conſidering that <hi>Maxentius</hi> was a great enemy to the Chriſtians, and had on his ſide an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the greateſt men within the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: It doth well appeare that that time was vtterly vnmeet for <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> to aduance Pope <hi>Siluester</hi> and the Romaine Clergie ſo greatly as this pretended donation would make vs beleeue.</p>
               <p>And truely in the very ſame yeres of this fourth Conſulſhip, the Senate of Rome did canoniſe and inrowle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the number of the Gods, the Emperor <hi>Diocleſian</hi> who dyed at that time

                  <hi>Vndouted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am of opinion that the traditions of the Church ought to be cut of, as ſoone as oportunity may fitly ſerue thereunto. For although it appeare not that they are contrary to the faith: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſlauiſh burthen of them doth oppreſſe Religion, which God of his mercy hath apointed to be free with the celebration of few Sacramentes, and thoſe very cleare: In ſo much that the ſtate of the Iewes is more tollerable tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the obſeruation of ſo many traditions. For though they know not the time of their libertie, yet doe they not ſubmitte themſelues to any Sacramentes at the preſumptious and fantaſticall appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Cnnon doth well declare how much they be wedded to their own affection, which in theſe dayes doe kindle coales in all places, and condemne all thoſe of hereſie, which doe leaue the traditions of men, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelues to the word of God.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3170:116"/> For with what cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance dare they call it hereſie, not to beleeue in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions of Popes, ſeeing that euen their own Canons doe wil vs to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the traditions of men? If this be hereſie then ought they to burne their Canon Law.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is very eaſie to be proued by their own Canons, that al the decrees and ordinaunces of the Popes, are either ſuperfluous or wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. For if they agree &amp; accord with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> word of god, they are ſuperfluous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ought to ſuffiſe vs to obſerue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of god, which haue no need to be ratified and authoriſed new a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by men. And if they be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or repugnant to the ordinances of God, then ought they to be reiected as wicked, as the auncient Canones themſelues doe witnes.

                  <hi>But in the matters that are openly reſolued by the Lord himſelf, or by his Apoſtles, or by the auncient Fathers that followed next vnto them,
<pb facs="tcp:3170:117"/> the Pope of Rome cannot make any law at all, but ought rather to maintain that which is already ordayned, yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſpending of his bloud and his life. For, if he ſhould take vpon him (which God forbid) to deſtroy that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Prophets haue taught, in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſhould ſhew himſelfe to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, &amp; not to geue ſound iudgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vpon this Cannon it is worthy to be noted, that the Popes authority exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth not ſo farre, as to deale with any thing which the Doctors, &amp; aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fathers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church haue taught, as it is farther auouched and proued by the Cannon following, attributed to Pope <hi>Zoſimus</hi> whiche ſayth thus: <hi>As touching the ſtatutes of the fathers, the authoritie of the Seate may neyther ordaine any thing contrary to them, nor chaunge any thing in them: for antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ought to be inuiolably rooted amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs, as beyng honorable by the decrees of the fathers,</hi> By which Cannons of Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> and Pope <hi>Zoſimus,</hi> it doth playnely appeere, that the auncient Cannons, (ſuch as thoſe be whiche we haue alleaged in this book to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the errors of the Romiſh church) ought to be of greater authoritie, than
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3170:117"/> the decrees, and ordinaunces of the latter Popes of our dayes, &amp; of their councels, which haue no power to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanul or altar any thing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtatutes, and doctrine of the auncient fathers.

               </p>
               <p>This Cannon teacheth vs a very good, and holy doctrine: which is to hould and retayne the pure doctrine of the truth, the feare of God, fayth &amp; charitie, &amp; then not to feare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications or thunderbolts of the Popes, or Biſhoppes (the which in theſe dayes they do rather vſe againſt ſuch as will not allow their errors, than againſt wicked liuers and ſuch as giue occaſion of offence) becauſe no man is able to put vs out of Gods Church, if we caſt not out our ſelues through our vices. Now, if vices and errors be the thinges which driue a man out of the Church of God, are there in theſe dayes any people in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3170:118"/> whole world which are more out of the Church than thoſe which think to driue out others?</p>
               <p>There remaine yet two pointes to treate of, touching this matter,<note place="margin">A perſonall ſucceſſion in the order of clergy.</note> namelye, the perſonall ſucceſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe of the Romain Clergy, (wherof they doe ſo greatly brag the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt the Proteſtantes) and their diſcipline. As touching the firſt point, they ſay they haue (as it were) a lineall ſucceſſion from age to age, of Biſhops and Shepheards from the Primitiue Church, and therefore that they be the true Shepheards: &amp; that by the contrary reaſon, the Miniſters of the goſpell which haue had no ſuch ſucceſſion, be falſe Shepheards. But this matter of ſucceſſion is very eaſie to be anſwered. For if you looke well into the hiſtories of the Popes, and conferre them with the canons both of late yeres and of olde time, you ſhal finde that the moſt part of the Popes and Biſhops came in at the window, and not at the dore. And that they haue been intruders and vſurpers, &amp; not lawfull ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>And to begin at the beginning, the canons doe teach vs (as truth is)
<pb facs="tcp:3170:119"/> that Biſhopricks and Eccleſiaſticall offices ought to be beſtowed by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full election, and that it is not lawfull for Biſhops and Shepheards to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point in their latter dayes who ſhall ſucceede them, but only to geue their opinion to their Churches, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch as they deeme in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to be moſt meete to ſucceede them. Thus ſaith a Canon taken out of the Counſell of Antioch.<note place="margin">e. Epiſcopo. c. vnde. <hi>8.</hi> q. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>It is not lawful for a Biſhop to chooſe or appoint who ſhall be his Succeſſor, though he be neere his death: and whatſoeuer he doth in that caſe, is nothing, nor nothinge worth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">That the Popes are intruders of the Papacy.</note>By which Canon it followeth, that Pope <hi>Clement</hi> (whom they vouch to be the Succeſſor of S. <hi>Peter</hi>) was no lawfull Pope. For there is another Canon which ſaith (if it be worthy to be beleued) that S. <hi>Peter</hi> drawing nie the end of his life, tooke S. <hi>Clement</hi> by the hand, and betooke vnto him the Church of Rome, chooſing him to be his ſucceſſor. Alſo Pope <hi>Damaſus</hi> (who was about the yere of our Lord <hi>371.</hi> in the time of the Emperor <hi>Valentinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi>) was made Biſhop or Pope of Rome by great hurliburlies, wherein there
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3170:119"/> were a hundred and ſeuen and thirty men ſlaine in the ſtreetes as <hi>Marcilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> doth witnes.<note place="margin">Am.

               <p>Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the eightth being a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (and therfore not capable of the Popedome) was borne in England, &amp; held the Papacie about two yeres and a halfe. Pope <hi>Silueſter</hi> the ſecond was a great Negromanſer, and came to be Pope by the help of the deuill, to whom he gaue both body and ſoule (as it is written in his hiſtory) and he raigned foure yeares and certaine Monethes. Pope <hi>Silueſter</hi> the third was made Pope by tumults and fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For in thoſe dayes (as ſayeth the hiſtory) the popedome was grow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>en to ſuch a ſtate, that it was geuen to him that would geue moſt for it, or which made moſt frends and fauour. Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eightth was made Pope by faction and bribery, hauing firſt by ſuttle practiſes gotten the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of his predeceſſor Pope <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine</hi> a man of a ſimple Wit, whom he cauſed to be ſtraitly ſhut vp in priſon, where he dyed for grief of mind when he ſaw himſelf ſo deceiued and il han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled. Wherupon it was ſayd by this <hi>Boniface,</hi> (a good witneſſe of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling)
<pb facs="tcp:3170:120"/> that he entered into the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome like a fox, raigned like a Lion, and died like a dog: for he dyed mad. Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the four and twentieth v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped the Papacie by force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and maintayned himſelfe in it by the ſame meanes, and was found to erre in the Chriſtian faith in moe than in fortie Articles: ſo holy was his holines.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, the hiſtories of the popes are full of the wicked dealings and practiſes which the Popes did vſe to attaine to that degree. Now therefore I aſke you whether theſe ought to be called lawfull ſucceſſors of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and whether thoſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes which were conſecrated by them, were lawfully called or not, or ought to be reputed the lawfull ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſors of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> primitiue church, &amp; whether the Curates and other Prieſtes that were promoted to holy order and to benefices by ſuch Biſhops, may be reckned as lawfull ſucceſſors of the Shepheards and Elders of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church. It is very ceataine that they were not:<note place="margin">c. Cum. in cunctis. c. Bona c.

               <p>If the Romiſh Catholickes deny this, they muſt alſo diſauow their own Canons, and deny the ſonne to haue light. And therefore the Romiſh Clergy are farre from the lawful and continuall ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Shepherds and Prieſts of the primatiue Church, wherein they imagine themſelues to to remayn. For ſure, Brybery, Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and ſuch other like practiſes, are

               <p>Nay contrariwiſe in theſe dayes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man ſeeth that to be a Biſhop,<note place="margin">A deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a Popiſh praelats prieſthood.</note> is a title of honor and dignitie, voyd of all other chardge than to make good cheere, and to keep a Biſhoply table, cauſing a kinde of ſeruice to be ſayd in the Church by ſome chapline of his for faſhion ſake.

               <p>Touching eccleſiaſticall goods (for the which our Clergy men contend in theſe dayes with tooth and nayle) let vs ſee a litle how the men of olde time did vſe them,<note place="margin">The vſe of church goodes.</note> and how they ought to be vſed by the auncient Canons. Firſt of all according to theſe Canons, they ought not to poſſeſſe any lands, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other temporall goods, but onely the tithes and offrings. Theſe are the
<pb facs="tcp:3170:126"/> very words of a Canon taken out of S. <hi>Iherome:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">c. Clericus. <hi>12.</hi> q. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>The Churchman ought to ſhew himſelfe to be ſuch a one as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth the Lord, and is poſſeſſed of the Lord. He that poſſeſſeth the Lord and ſayeth with the Prophet, the Lord is my porcion, can poſſeſſe nothing but the Lord. And if he poſſeſſe any other thing, the Lord will not be his porcion. As for example, if he poſſeſſe ſiluer, gold, lands, or moueables, the Lord diſdaineth to be his porcion amongſt theſe things. Alſo if I be the porcion of the Lord, and the meeteline of his heritage, I haue no part with the other tribes, but (as a Leuite &amp; Prieſt) I liue of the tenths and ſeruing at the altar: I am found by the offerings of the altar: hauing my food and clothing, I content me therwith, and naked I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the naked croſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I do aſke of you how wel this Canon is performed in theſe dayes? Haue not the clergy men all the beſt &amp; goodlieſt poſſeſſions, rentes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenewes that are to be found, ouer and beſides their tithes &amp; offerings? If the caſe concerne the demaunding of tithes, they can ſkil to ſay that they belong to them, as to thoſe that hold the place of the Leuites, to whom (by the old law of Moyſes) the tenthes
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3170:126"/> ought to belong. But if it bee put to them that they ought not to poſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny landes or temperall inheritaunce, as indeed the leuites did not, becauſe it was forbidden them by the law: They will not then be Leuites anye longer, nor ſay that they repreſented them. It is not amiſſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrue it to moſt aduantage, that they may bee gathering on all handes thereby. As touching tithes and offerings,<note place="margin">How the goods of the Church ought to be vſed.</note> let vs now ſee how the biſhops and prieſts did vſe the tenthes in old tymes, and how they ought to vſe them now, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the canons. That is, that they owght to deuide the reuenew of the tenthes and offeringes, into foure partes: Whereof one fourth part was to be geuen to the Byſhop, to mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne him &amp; his family, that he might keepe hoſpitality for ſtraungers: an other fourth part was to goe to the prieſtes and clergy of his Church: an other fourth part was to be beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon the poore: and the laſt fourth part was to be imploied in the repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his churches. Harken to the expres words of a canon taken out of S. <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> which ſayth thus.<note place="margin">c. Quatuor, &amp;c. Mos. eſt. <hi>12.</hi> q. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>All the reuenewes and offerings of the Church, ought to be deuided into foure partes, if
<pb facs="tcp:3170:127"/> the value thereof will beare it, (as is found to haue bene decreed long agoe,) Whereof one part belongeth to the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, an other to the Clarkes, the thyrd to the poore, and the fourth is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in building.</hi> And an other Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeaketh thus. <hi>It is the cuſtome of the Apoſtolicke Seate, to commaunde the new made Byſhopes to deuide all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenewes of his Biſhopricke into foure partes: the one part for himſelfe and hys family, and to the keeping of hoſpitality, an other for the clergy, the third part for the poore, and the fourth for the repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how the tenths and offerings were beſtowed in old time. But in theſe dayes the diſtribution &amp; imployment of them is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for the Prieſts vſe the partition of the Lyon, taking all to themſelues, and leauing no part to the poore. And yet haue we ſeene euen in our time, that theſe auncient Canons haue bin ſet in force againe by the ſtatutes of Orleance, in the raign of the late king <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, in the yeare <hi>1561.</hi> for there is a branch of that ſtatute, which ſaith that the fourth part of the tenths ſhall be diſtributed to the poore of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3170:127"/> Countrey where they are leuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the Clergiemen haue ſo wel handled the matter by ſetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt it, &amp; by their appeales that the ſaid branch could neuer yet be put in execution, nor attaine any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at all, ſo charitable are they to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the poore. And yet by the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Canons the tenths are named the tributes of the poore.<note place="margin">Tithes are the tribute of the poore.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe which doe not pay their tithes well, be counted gilty of the death of the poore, which die for want and neceſſitie. How much more gilty then are they which can ſo well exacte the tenthes, &amp; keep all to themſelues, and geue naught to the poore? Let vs harken (I pray you) how the canons doe thunder againſt ſuch kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as doe withhold the goods of the needy.<note place="margin">c. Decema. <hi>16.</hi> q. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>The tenths</hi> (ſaith the Canon) <hi>are the tributes of needy ſoules, ſo that if thou payeſt wel thy tithes thou ſhalt not only receaue aboundance of fruites, but alſo health of body and ſoule. He that payeth them not, is an vſurper of other mennes goods. And looke how many poore folke doe die for want of ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the place where he dwelleth, of ſo many murders ſhall he be gilty before
<pb facs="tcp:3170:128"/> the ſeate of the eternall iudge, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting of the thinges to his own vſe, which are appointed for the poore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſurely the Church of old time could ſo ill away with ſuch an abuſe in the Clergie, as is the withholding of the goods of the poore, that it wold neuer haue ſuffered it. But contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (by the auncient Canons) the Biſhops and the reſt of the Clergie, ſhould haue been conſtrayned to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor the poore and needy with the gold and ſiluer of the Church, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it rather in this work of charity, than in making of faire buildings and in repayring of Churches. Theſe are the words of a Canon taken out of S. <hi>Ambroſe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">c. Aurum. <hi>12</hi> q. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>The Church hath gold, not to hoord it vp, but to diſtribute it to the needy. To what end ſhould a man keepe that, which ſerueth him to no purpoſe. Do we not know what a great quantitie of gold and ſiluer the Aſſiriens tooke out of the temple of the Lorde? were it not much better that the prieſtes ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe it to the releefe of the poore and needy, than that the wicked enemye ſhould ſpoyle it and carry it away? will not the Lord ſay vnto yov, wherefore haue ye ſuffered ſo many needy folke to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3170:128"/> dye for hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gar? For thou hadſt gold wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou mighteſt haue bought them meate: wherefore haſt thou ſuffered ſo many Captiues to be led into bondage, and to be killed by the enemy for lack of beyng redeemed? It had bene much better for thee to haue ſaued the veſſels of lyfe, then the veſſels of mettall. Thou ſhalt not know what to aunſwere vnto this, for what wilt thou ſay? That thou waſt afrayd leaſt the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of God ſhould not haue bene well garniſhed? I ſay vnto thee, that the Sacramentes haue no neede of gould. The thinges which are not to be boughte for golde, are neuer the more acceptable for the golds ſake. The redemption of Captiues is the ornament of holy thinges. And truely theſe are the precious veſſels, which do ſaue mens ſoules from death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That is the true treaſor of the Lord, which couereth that whiche his bloud hath couered.</hi> And the next Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing taken out of <hi>S. Iherom,</hi>

For by them we be taught, neuer to conceale the truth, but bould<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to ſpeake it vpon payne to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted oppreſſors of the ſame, and allowers of error.

                  <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> Of Purgatorye. The xii. chapter.</head>
               <p>THe Romain Catholicks doe hold opinion, that there is a certaine place within the earth which is not altogether ſo low as hell, whether the ſoules of the good Chriſtians which are dead, doe goe to purge them of their ſinnes by tormentes of fire and other rigorous paynes: and that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deadly ſinne ſhould, by deſart, haue ſeuen yeares of purgation, if the term of yeares were not ſhortned by maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſuffrages, and pardons. And for this cauſe they doe hold opinion, that it is needfull to cauſe a great number of maſſes and ſuffrages to be ſayd for them that be dead, and to the ſame end to geue legacies and foundacions of Obites to maſſeprieſts and chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryprieſts, and to make good prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of pardons, ſpecially in the time of the great Iubileis and Croyſſeys, which they ſell very good cheape.</p>
               <p>And in very truth this doctrine of Purgatory hath exceedingly inriched the Cleargie,<note place="margin">Purgatory the inricher of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gye.</note> yea more than any other thing. For there dyed not ſo poore a wretch which gaue not ſome legacie to the prieſt, (yea often times euen the
<pb facs="tcp:3170:131"/> beſt thing they had) to haue them ſing maſſes for the caſe of their ſoules, and to ſhorten the time of their abode in purgatory. And hereunto were al ſick folke perſwaded by their Confeſſors, which would make great difficultye &amp; nicenes to geue them abſolution, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they would promiſe to geue one thing or other to the church.</p>
               <p>And the better to draw them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, they made them beleue that for euery mortall ſinne, their ſoules ſhold remain (as is ſaid) ſeuen yeares in the paynes of purgatory, which would be an infinite time, if it were not ſhorte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by maſſes. For, ſay they, although that God doe in this world, pardon the ſinnes of all ſuch as confeſſe them to the prieſt and make ſatiſfaction, yet doth he remit but the ſinne only, and not the payne, ſo as we muſt needes goe to purgacory to ſuffer paynes for al the ſinnes which we haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all our life time: Which paines are ſo great, as greater are not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For (ſay they) there is as greate difference betwixt the fire of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and the fire of this world, as is betwixt a burning coale &amp; the breath of a mannes mouth. By reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the poore world had ſo great feare
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3170:131"/> and conceit of this hote fire of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and of the infinite time which they ſhould be fayn to remaine there, accounting ſeuen yeares for euery mortall ſinne which was committed in a mannes life time, that euery man gaue vnto the Prieſtes, as much as they would craue, to the end that their time in purgatory might be ſhortned. But contrary to this doctrine, the Proteſtantes doe hold opinion that we haue no other purgatory than the bloud of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Ghriſt,</hi> which waſheth away and clenſeth all mens ſinnes which beleue in him. And they ſay that his precious bloud is more then ſufficient to wipe out all our ſinnes, without hauing neede to be purged by any fier. And that our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>our doth not clenſe vs by halfes, but throughly altogether, and we ſhould doe him wrong and iniury, to beleue that we haue need of any other kinde of clenſing, than of that which he him ſelfe maketh, in iuſtifying vs by bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our iniquities, and by wyping away our ſinnes and blemiſhes: And that it is a mockery to ſay that God doth pardon our ſinnes, and not the payn due for ſinne: as if you wold ſay, he forgeueth vs the dets that we doe
<pb facs="tcp:3170:132"/> owe him, but not the payment of the dettes: for he will haue that ſtill.</p>
               <p>And now (to ſay the truth) all men may eaſily iudge that this doctrine is better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doctrine of the Romiſh Catholickes, according to our firſt rule, becauſe that by the ſame, Chriſt our Redeemer is moſt honored, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuche as he is acknowledged to be the only and whole purger of our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and our true and only Atto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nementmaker and Iuſtifyer.</p>
               <p>And aſfor the holy ſcripture, that doth teach vs that the faythfull and choſen of God do dye vnto the Lord and that thoſe which dye vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord are very happy, &amp; do go into the place of reſt. Theſe are the expreſſe wordes of S. <hi>Iohn. <hi>Happy are they which from this time forth do dye to the Lord:</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14.13.</note> 
                  <hi>for they do reſt from their labors.</hi> And for thoſe which dye not to the Lord, foraſmuch as they be none of his, nor members of the body of the true church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of chriſt is the head: it is certayne that there is no ſaluation for them. And therefore it is in vayne to imagine a purgatory, either for the one, or for the other. For as many as die to the lord, go preſently to reſt &amp; not into purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. And thoſe which doe not dye to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3170:132"/> the Lord, do go into euerlaſting payn (not into purgatorye) and there is no ſaluation for them. And as for the text taken out of the booke of the Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees, which alloweth prayer for the dead,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Machab.</hi> 12.43. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.39.</note> and ſo by conſequence purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alſo: The Proteſtantes ſay that it ought to be houlden for a certayn and vndoubted rule, that we ought not to build any article or fayth vpon the bookes called <hi>Apocripha,</hi> of which nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this booke of the Machabyes is one: inſomuch as the Author there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that wrate it, confeſſeth that he may perchaunce haue ouerſhot himſelfe, and that he hath written in ſimple ſtile, and that he was not of ſkill to write any better: which is an vnmeete kinde of ſpeech for the holy Ghoſt, who can not erre nor hath any neede to be excuſed for ſpeaking in a baſe ſtile: for when he liſteth he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in a higher ſtile than the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenteſt Orators that ouer were in the world.</p>
               <p>And as touching the text where it is ſayes: <hi>that the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt is not pardoned, neither in this world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.32</note>

<pb facs="tcp:3170:133"/> that then the other ſinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuen in the other world, and ſo by conſequence, that there muſt nedes be a purgatory: the proteſtantes affirme that to be an ill concluſion. For in ſo ſaying our Lord Ieſus Chriſt mente nothing elſe, but that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſinne againſte the holy Ghoſt ſhal neuer be forgeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. S. <hi>Oregory</hi> himſelf (as we will declare hereafter) doth not ſay that all other ſinnes ſauing the ſinne agaynſt the holy Ghoſt, ſhall be pardoned in the world to come: but onely that the ſmaleſt ſort of ſinnes which are called veniall ſinnes, ſhalbe then forgeuen. Let vs now come to the Canons.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Prayer for the dead is diſproued.</note>There are two peeces of Canons in the decrees of <hi>Graecian,</hi> which may eaſely quench and confound purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For by the one it is ſayd that in this world one of vs may wel be hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the prayers of another: But when we depart from hence to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before the ſeate of Chriſt, euery man muſt beare his own burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and then the prayers of Saints which are in paradiſe will nothing auaile vs, and much leſſe will the prayers of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this world ſtand vs in any ſteade. Theſe are the wordes of the Canon.<note place="margin">c. Inpraeſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti. <hi>13.</hi> q. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>In this preſent world we know we may
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3170:133"/> helpe one another with our prayers and good aduice: but when we come before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt, then ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iob.</hi> nor <hi>Daniell,</hi> nor <hi>Noe,</hi> can pray for any, but euery man ſhall then beare his own burthen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Canon ſayth that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the biſhops nor the Apoſtles can aſſoyle the dead of their ſinnes: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it followeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men haue bought the Popes pardons in vaine, for the redeeming of thoſe which are ſayd to haue been in Purgatory. Theſe are the very words of the ſaid Canon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the decrees of Pope <hi>Gelaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>c.</hi> 2. 24, <hi>q.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>We reade that Chriſt hath rayſed the dead to life: But we read not that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he releaſed any of thoſe which were dead in ſinne. And he who only had the power to doe it, hath geuen this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall commaundement to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaying: <hi>That which thou vnbindeſt vpon earth, ſhall be vnbound in heauen, and that which thou bindest vpon earth ſhall be bound in heauen.</hi> He ſayth vpon earth, but he neuer ſayd that he which is departed bound by ſin, ſhalbe releaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Canon doth well ſhew, that the power to vnbinde doth not ſtretch ſo farre as to hell, nor ſo farre as to the pretended Purgatory, but
<pb facs="tcp:3170:134"/> only to the earth: and that the Popes of late yeares haue gone about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the boundes of their territories to farre, in commaunding the angels (as they doe by their bulles of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons) to goe fetch the ſoules of ſuch out of purgatory, as the Popes themſelues liſted to name, for they haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement that reacheth either higher or lower than the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Whence prayer for the deade commeth.</note>It is true that for ground of this doctrine of Purgatory, they alleadge that the cuſtome of praying for the dead hath been allowed and receaued now of long time, euen from the time of the primitiue Church. But it doth not therby follow, but that an error is an error, although it be neuer ſo old.<note place="margin">c.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">De Ciuit. Dei. lib. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>24.</hi>
                  </note>S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo wryteth (how be it that he alloweth not the opinion) that ſome auncient Fathers haue i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined, that to pray for the damned
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3170:134"/> ſort, might doe them good, not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt them from eternall payne, but to moderate their torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although that this kinde of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the dead were ſufferable, (as in deede it is not) ſeeing it hath no foundation in the word of God, yet cannot Purgatory be grounded ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, foraſmuch as the praying of the Fathers of olde time, was either for thoſe which were happy in Paradiſe, for that their glory and bleſſedneſſe might increaſe, or for thoſe which were damned, that their payne might be diminiſhed, and not for any which they beleeued to haue bin lodged in Purgatory. For in thoſe dayes they knew not yet what was meante by Purgatory, nor where Purgatory ſtoode. For it is but a late inuention of the new deſcriptions of hell.</p>
               <p>The famoſeſt doctor that euer ſpake of Purgatory, is S. <hi>Gregory:</hi>

               <p>

But yet we muſt beleue that before the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, there is a fire of purgation for certayne degrees of ſinnes, becauſe the truth ſayth, that if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the holy Ghoſt, his ſinnes ſhall not be forgeuen, neither in this world nor in the world to come. By which wordes it is geuen vs to vnderſtand, that there are ſome ſinnes which may be pardoned in this world, and ſome in the world to come. For that which is denied in one ſinne, is graunted in an other by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent interpretation. But yet (as I haue ſayd) you muſt vnderſtand this to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken of the leaſte ſinnes, as the ſpeaking many idle wordes, to much laughter, to great carefulnes for a mans owne family (which is a ſinne that can hardly be ſhu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Now it is certayn, that with God, a thouſand, yea and twelue hundred thouſand yeares, are no more than an hower, or a quarter of an hower, and therfore by the lapſe of ſo litle ſpace of time, preſcription can take no aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. But all men of ſound iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t will alwayes grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that as time doth not change the truth into vntruth, nor vntruth into truth: So alſo of conſequence we muſt not admit a Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for true and good, vnder colour that it hath indured long time, ſeeing that the exception of preſcription is not to be admitted in ſuch caces.</p>
               <p>For els if the Romiſh Catholickes will needes ſticke to the Iudgement of preſcription for the allowance of a Religion: then muſt they make good the religion of Mahomet, which hath already laſted aboue a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yeres, which thing I am ſure that none of them will doe, how paſſionate ſoeuer they be otherwiſe. And if it be demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded wherefore god hath ſo long tyme ſuffered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> error of Mahomet amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the <hi>Turkes, Perſians, Arrabians, Sirians,</hi> &amp; the other Eſterne and Southern peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> among whom
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3170:138"/> the Apoſtles and diſciples of Ieſus Chriſt preached the Goſpell and pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo many fayre Churches: there is no other anſwere to be made vnto it. but that god hath done it by his ſecret iudgement, wherof we are ignorant. Full well we know that he hath done it for good and a iuſt cauſe, &amp; to good purpoſe, becauſe he doth nothing but that which is good and iuſt. But it doth not become vs to ſearch any deeper for the perticuler cauſes which haue moued him ſo to doe, neither ought we to be inquiſitiue of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities and ſecret di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

The ſame alſo is to be anſwered, to ſuch as ſay that it is not likely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God would ſuffer the people of Chriſtendome to erre, ſo long as ſince the maſſe hath had his full ſcope. For (to be ſhort) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God is the truth it ſelfe and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his word is true: it is much better to yeld God his due honor by ſticking onely to his word, then to refort to cuſtome and preſcription of time, to authoriſe the traditions of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 5.21.</note> Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe doth teach vs playne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, that we ought to reiect the traditions of men, although they be neuer ſo auncient, and grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon preſcription of time out of minde, and
<pb facs="tcp:3170:139"/> that we ought alwayes to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe back to the pure word of God, which ſhal laſt for euer, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing al cuſtomes &amp; preſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which are agaynſt it. For in reprouing the traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Phariſies which had then bene receiued &amp; allowed of long time, he exhorteth his diſciples to caſt them of, and to returne back agayne to the pure word of God, and to the naturall meaning thereof ſaying: you haue heard how it was ſayd to the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of old time &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As for the auncient Canons, they are ſo cleare and expreſſe in this caſe, as is poſſible &amp; therfore it ſhall ſuffice me to tranſlate them here ſimply. Theſe be the very wordes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">c. Mala. c ſi conſuetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem. c.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>An ill cuſtome is no les to be reiected &amp; ſhunned, then a peſtilent infection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that if it be not the ſooner plucked vp the wicked do ſerue their turne with it as it were by right of priuiledge: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the ſundry diſorders and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers vſurpatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which are not repreſſed out of hand begin anon after to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued for lawes, and are alwayes obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as priuiledges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which Canon wee may well note the pernicious effectes of ill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, which cauſe vs to receiue vice
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3170:139"/> in ſteade of vertue, and euill in ſteade of good: wherof our miſerable world hath to many examples, as well in cauſes of Religion as in matters of pollicie and law. For in theſe dayes men defend nothing more earneſtly, than the abuſes and errors which are in all eſtates, vnder pretence that they haue taken root by long cuſtome and contynuance of time, which haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to paſſe in force of lawes and Priuileges.</p>
               <p>Another Canon taken out of ſaint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſayth thus:<note place="margin">Al cuſtome muſt giue place to trueth.</note> 
                  <hi>If a man happen to obiect cuſtome againſt vs, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what the Lord ſayth: I am the way (ſaith he) the truth and the life. He doth not ſay I am cuſtome. And truely (as ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth S. <hi>Ciprian</hi>) all cuſtome although it be neuer ſo auncient, adde receiued, ought to be ſet aſide in reſpect of the truth, &amp; all cuſtome which is contrarye to the truth ought to be aboliſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is yet another Canon which ſingeth thus: <hi>In vayne do they alledge cuſtome, which are ouercome by reaſon as though cuſtome were of greater force then the truth. Or as though in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thinges we ſhould not follow that which hath bene reuealed by the holy Ghoſt. Certaynly it is a true thing, that
<pb facs="tcp:3170:140"/> reaſon and truth are to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cuſtome. But if cuſtome be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the truth, it ought to be conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept and retayned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is yet another Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſpeaketh fitly of this matter, take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of S. <hi>Ciprian,</hi> ſaying thus: <hi>The cuſtome that is crept into any place, ought to be no impediment but that the truth ſhold be preferred and get the vpper hand: for cuſtome without truth is nothing els but a geuing of contynuaunce vnto error. Wherfore let vs leaue the error, &amp; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the truth: knowing that in <hi>Eſdras,</hi> truth getteth the vpper hand, according as it is written, Truth preuayleth and getteth the maſtery, and lyueth for euer, and ſhall indure world without end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To come to an end, I wil adde this one Canon &amp; no more: For I ſhould not haue done very ſoone, if I would rehearſe all the Canones that are to purpoſe touching this matter. And thus ſayth this Canon: <hi>If only Chriſt ought to be heard, then muſt we not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the thinges which other men that haue been before our time, haue thought meete to be done, but rather vpon that which Chriſt hath done, who is before all. For we ought not to folow the cuſtome of men, but the truth of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3170:140"/> God, ſpecially ſeeing that he ſaith by the mouth of <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet, In vayn doe they honor me, by teaching the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements and doctrines of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in very deede this Cannon ſhould make the whole rable of the Canoniſtes, Decretiſtes Sarboniſts, Sophiſtes, and others which handell the bookes of the Romiſh diuinity, to bluſh for ſhame, that they ſhould ſtrayne them ſelues to vphold the doctrines which haue bene appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly inuented by men. For this one Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non doth arregne them and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne them, al in few wordes.</p>
               <p>Now to come to an end of this tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atiſe,<note place="margin">An exhorta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion vnto peace.</note> I pray the Romiſh Catholikes to vouchſafe, to looke aduiſedly into the poynes hertofore by me diſcuſſed: and to examine and ponder them throughly and without paſſion, if it be poſſible. For in ſo doing I am ſure, that as many as haue any naturall diſcreſſion in them, ſhall find that the Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Proteſtants, is a farre other thing then they haue hitherto taken it to be, or than it hath bine borne them in hand to be. And when they ſhall perceaue that the ſayd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (at the leaſt) is neither wicked, nor hereticall, nor new (as euen the
<pb facs="tcp:3170:141"/> moſt ſimple may eaſely diſcern by the points before treated of) it may be a iuſt occaſion for them (if they be not ſtrangely bereft of their right wittes) to incline to liue henceforth in peace and concord, with the profeſſors of the ſayd Religion.</p>
               <p>And herewithall I beſeech them to haue earneſt conſideration of twoo thinges. The one is, that without a good peace and concord betwixt the Catholicks and the Proteſtants, the ſtate of the Realme of Fraunce will not only run wholy to ruine, but alſo come to vtter vndoing and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And he that ſeeth not this, is very groſſe &amp; ignorant. For Ciuill warres (when they contynue) do neuer bring forth other effectes, than the changes and deſtructions of common weales, vnles ſome good and vertuous men that are louers of the common weale, doe fortune to preuent ſuch vnhappy and euil deſtinies, by procuring ſome good and reaſonable pacification, as the hiſtories do yeald vs infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples therof.</p>
               <p>The other thing to be conſidered of is this. That euery perticular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought to bethink himſelfe that he hath a ſoule to ſaue, and that he ought
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3170:141"/> to ſeeke the way of his ſaluation. For to what purpoſe ſerueth it to haue gotten honor, glory, riches, and other contentments of the world, to him that followeth the way of damnation to his own wretched ſoule? Now he that is determined to ſeeke the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſoule, will he ſay that he is contented to beleeue as his Curate doth beleeue? Such reſolution were to fooliſh and beaſtly. Or will it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice him to ſay that he will liue as his Predeceſſors haue done, and follow cuſtome? That were alſo a wronge way; and is already condemned by the Canones heretofore alleadged. Then ought we to determine with our ſelues to follow the truth, and to imbrace the true doctrine of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus but lord &amp; Sauior, or elſe we ſhall neuer attayn to ſaluation. And when we be thus reſolued, we muſt take heed that our paſſions doe not blinde the eyes of our vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, &amp; cauſe vs to take blacke for white. For if we ſay ſtil, we haue bene led and brought vp in this Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, my father &amp; grand fathers? (which were good men) haue died in the ſame, I haue borne Arms and ventred my life to mayntayne it, it were not now for my honor to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb facs="tcp:3170:142"/> the Religion agaynſt which I haue fought, I am of the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that there is no ill in the religion that I hould, I am now to olde to learne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, and ſuch other trifling excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: we do greatly deceaue our ſelues, for they are nothing auaileable before god, with whom we may not dally in this ſort. For ſuch ſhiftes of deſcant ſerue to no other ond, but to trifle our mindes, and to lull them a ſleep in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and darckenes, that they may haue no ſkill of their ſaluation when they depart this world. What is then to be done that we may come into the path of ſaluation? we muſt ſeek the truth. And where ſhall we find it? eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there whether Chriſt did ſend vs whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayd ſearch the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The father of all mercy, who hath created and made vs for of his owne glory and honor ſake, geue vs all ſuch grace, that being inlightened by hys holy ſpirit, we may be well edified in the pure doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt hys ſonne our Sauiour, to the ende that being true Chriſtians in name and effect, we may liue in good vnitye peace, brotherly and chriſtianly loue together in his holy ſeruice.</p>
